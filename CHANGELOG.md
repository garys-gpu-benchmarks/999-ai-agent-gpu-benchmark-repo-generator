# Changelog

## 2026-10-10 — Template CI: junk-file check no longer trips on the unit tests' __pycache__

- **Failure:** the generator's own "Template CI" (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, job lint-and-validate) failed on every push (run #3, commit 56eb3dd, v1.0.7/v1.0.8) with "Process completed with exit code 1". Every step passed except the last: "Unit tests" runs `pytest`, which creates `__pycache__` folders on the runner, and "Check for leftover personal paths, secrets, or lock files" then ran `find . -name '__pycache__'` and failed on them. The repository has no committed `__pycache__` (`.gitignore` excludes it). Only the generator runs this check; the workloads use the shared ci.yml, which does not.
- **Fix:** the check now looks at committed files only: `git ls-files | grep -qE '(^|/)(__pycache__/|~\$)'`. A committed `__pycache__` file or Office lock file (`~$...`) still fails the job.
- **Checked:** on a clone of 56eb3dd after `pytest` (23 `__pycache__` folders on disk) the step passes; a force-added `__pycache__/a.pyc` and a `~$lock.xlsx` are both caught; actionlint 1.7.12 with shellcheck 0.9.0 passes. All other Template CI steps passed locally on that clone (135 tests).

## 2026-10-09 — shared-workflows Self-test: actionlint SC2015 in gpu-smoke.yml

- **Failure:** the first publish of `shared-workflows` (commit 1e190b7, Self-test run 37946198959) failed in "lint reusable workflows". actionlint runs every `run:` script through the runner's shellcheck, and Ubuntu runner shellcheck 0.9/0.10 reports `command -v rocm-smi >/dev/null && rocm-smi --showproductname || true` in the "Verify pre-provisioned GPU stack" step as SC2015 ("A && B || C is not if-then-else"). actionlint fails on any finding, so v1 was not moved and no workload was pushed. shellcheck 0.11 no longer reports it, which is why it passed on a newer local install.
- **`templates/shared-workflows/.github/workflows/gpu-smoke.yml`:** now `if command -v rocm-smi >/dev/null; then rocm-smi --showproductname || true; fi`. Same behavior: print the product name when rocm-smi exists, never fail on it.
- **Checked:** actionlint 1.7.12 on the published tree with this line changed passes with shellcheck 0.9.0, 0.10.0 and 0.11.0 (0.9.0 and 0.10.0 reproduce the failure without it).

## 2026-10-08 — TEMPLATE_00_103: one shared, versioned CI for every workload

Workloads no longer carry their own CI logic. Already generated repositories are unchanged until they are regenerated.

- **Contract.** New `config/ci_contract.yaml` (generation-only) holds the GitHub owner (`garys-gpu-benchmarks`), the `shared-workflows` repo and tag (`v1`), the caller inputs (`vendor`, `os_label`, `profile`), runner labels, timeouts, and pinned tool versions (ruff 0.16.8, actionlint 1.7.12). `scripts/ci_contract.py` derives each workload's vendor/OS/bundle and renders templates.
- **Callers.** `init_generated_repo.py` renders `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `gpu-smoke.yml` from `templates/workload/.github/workflows/` instead of copying `docs/examples/generated-repo-workflows/*.example`, and fails generation when a caller does not match the contract. `nightly.yml` and the workload `.github/dependabot.yml` are no longer emitted; `prepare_github_publish.sh` removes them from older trees and no longer patches workflow files.
- **Shared workflows.** `templates/shared-workflows/` (emitted once by `scripts/emit_shared_workflows.py --output-root <Repos_To_Github>`): hosted `ci.yml` (shellcheck `--severity=warning`, strict ruff, syntax, spec schema, seeded-fixture validation, required files, actionlint, per-check job summary; every check runs), self-hosted `gpu-smoke.yml` (runner `[self-hosted, gpu, <vendor>, <os_label>]`, OS check, stack verification without installs, `results/environment.json`, `run_benchmark.sh --profile <p> --validate`, headline metrics, artifact upload), `self-test.yml` against a sample workload, Dependabot, README with the versioning and fork-safety policy. Least-privilege `permissions` and `actions/checkout@v7`, `setup-python@v7`, `upload-artifact@v7` throughout.
- **Fixed in the old CI.** The published `ci.yml` called `scripts/validate_template_inputs.py`, which `prepare_github_publish.sh` deletes, and swallowed ruff with `|| true`. The GPU job reinstalled the stack with `setup.sh --assume-yes` every run and could land on any vendor's runner.
- **Lint backlog.** Explicit ruff rules (`E4,E7,E9,F`) in `config/pyproject.toml`; 63 findings fixed across `scripts/` and `implementation_components/` (unused imports and variables, intentional late imports marked). Shellcheck warnings fixed in `collect_hw_sw_info.sh` (and its generator), `lib/nvcc_glibc_throw.sh`, `lib/hipcc_host_gcc.sh`, `smoke_check_generated_repo.sh`. `validate_results.py` (from `materialize_generated_harness.py`) drops an unused variable; workloads without a compile step get a real no-op `scripts/build.sh` instead of an empty file.
- **Suite tools.** `templates/suite-tools/` holds `run_benchmark_suite.sh` and `get_remote_info.sh` (example hosts replaced with documentation addresses), emitted to `gpu-bench-suite/`.
- **README and checks.** `README_TEMPLATE.md` gets a live CI badge, a "Continuous Integration" section, and the `git clone --recurse-submodules` bundle command. `self_check_generated_repo.sh`, `check_github_publish_ready.sh`, the submission checklist, `AGENTS.md` (CI Workflow Contract) and the generator README ("Continuous Integration") describe and enforce the new contract. Template CI pins permissions, runs the unit tests, and renders and actionlints the shared templates. New `tests/test_ci_contract.py`.

## 2026-10-06 — Three-line generation prompt

The chatbox entry point is `scripts/run_from_prompt.py`. It reads a `Generate workloads ...` line and an optional `ssh` line, writes repositories in the parent of this generator, and calls `create_one_workload.py` without a `--remote-root` argument. `docs/AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` states the minimal prompt and the defaults that no longer need to be pasted. An always-on `.cursor/rules/generate-workloads.mdc` rule keeps that contract in force. A trailing `inclusive` on a range is ignored. Git Bash rewriting `/opt/benchmarks` to `C:/Program Files/Git/opt/benchmarks` is undone, and `/root` or `/opt/workloads` is rejected.

## 2026-10-06 — NCCL baseline fits under 5 minutes

`Parameters_SmokeBaselineExtend` baseline `num_iterations` for 216 and 416 were scaled from the slower overnight run so baseline lands near 4:00 (under 5 min). Overlay rounds stay 10. Smoke stays 2 and extended stays 620000. Command columns were regenerated.

- **216:** 480000 → 295000 (measured 6:12 and 6:30).
- **416:** 480000 → 244000 (measured 6:13 and 7:53). The 2026-09-28 note named 330000, but the cell that ran was 480000.

## 2026-10-05 — NUMA pointer hops fit 4 and 12 minutes

`Parameters_SmokeBaselineExtend` `num_iterations` for 110, 210, 310, and 410 were scaled from the slower run in `Aggregate_Project322_100_200_300_400_20261005a` so baseline lands near 4:00 (3–5 min) and extended near 12:00 (8–15 min). Smoke stays 20000. Command columns were regenerated.

- **110:** 2500000000 / 7400000000 → 890000000 / 2600000000 (measured 11:13 and 33:58).
- **210:** 780000000 / 2300000000 → 460000000 / 1670000000 (measured 6:47 and 16:34).
- **310:** 1800000000 / 4000000000 → 950000000 / 2750000000 (measured 7:36 and 17:27).
- **410:** 780000000 / 2300000000 → 580000000 / 1760000000 (measured 5:23 and 15:43).

## 2026-10-05 — Mistral consolidated.safetensors is not a finished checkpoint

These are generator overlays. The next `create_one_workload.py` run picks them up. Already generated repositories are unchanged.

- **132/232/332/432 RAG.** `has_causal_lm_weights` no longer accepts `consolidated.safetensors`. A snapshot counts only with `model.safetensors`, `pytorch_model.bin`, or a complete `model.safetensors.index.json` shard set. `prefetch_rag_models.py` downloads those Hugging Face files and leaves the consolidated file for vLLM. The runner calls `ensure_mistral` before `local_files_only` and exits when Transformers reports missing causal-LM weights. Do not alias `consolidated.safetensors` to `model.safetensors`: the original key names initialize a random Mistral and still exit 0.
- **130/131/330/331 SGLang.** Baseline and extended run `scripts/prefetch_sglang_model.py` and pass the printed snapshot directory to `sglang.launch_server`. Smoke still uses `scripts/tiny_sglang_server.py`. A repo id against a consolidated-only cache makes SGLang fetch the index, ignore the consolidated file, and exit before the shards exist. Extended was passing only because a later run found the shards already downloaded.

## 2026-10-04 — 418 convolution length and setup-excluded runtime

- **418 iterations.** Baseline `num_iterations` is 100000 (was 168000) and extended is 320000 (was 514000). On the Ubuntu 26.04 H100 those previous counts ran 7:50 and 23:50. The new counts scale to about 4:40 and 14:50. Smoke stays 2. Workloads 118, 218, and 318 are unchanged.
- **Runtime clock.** `mark_benchmark_measure_start` runs after `ensure_setup.sh` returns, so `total_runtime_mm_ss` is the benchmark. `begin_benchmark_run` still starts first, and a setup failure still writes a ledger row from that earlier timestamp.

## 2026-10-04 — ResNet labels name the largest batch

- **122/222/322/422.** Each of the five headline labels now says the largest batch. The keys are unchanged. Per-batch values stay in the `case_*` columns, and `headline_batch_size` names the copied batch.

## 2026-10-04 — rocSOLVER LU labels for 120 and 320

- **120/320 #1 and #2.** The labels are "Mean rocSOLVER LU FP64, TFLOPS" and "Mean rocSOLVER LU time, s." The keys stay `sustained_fp64_performance_across_problem_size_n_tflops` and `time_to_solution_across_problem_size_n_s`. The binary remains single-GPU `dgetrf` and `dgetrs` at one N.

## 2026-10-04 — NUMA latency uses a random pointer chase

- **110/210/310/410 pattern.** Smoke, baseline, and extended set `access_pattern` to `random`. The sweep default is random as well. Sequential remains available with `--pattern sequential`.
- **Labels.** #1 is "Largest cache-tier pointer-chase latency, ns." #2 is "Local DRAM pointer-chase latency, ns." #3 is "Pointer-chase payload rate, GB/s." #4 is "DRAM-tier cache misses/s." The keys are unchanged.

## 2026-10-04 — STREAM Best Rate label and AMD parse failure

- **107/307 parse failure.** Copy, Scale, Add, and Triad no longer default to 1.0 GB/s. A missing kernel line prints `[FAIL] STREAM did not report <name>` and returns 1 before the CSV, matching 207/407.
- **107/207/307/407 labels.** Each bandwidth label now starts with "Best". The keys stay `copy_bandwidth_gb_s`, `scale_bandwidth_gb_s`, `add_bandwidth_gb_s`, and `triad_bandwidth_gb_s`. The parsed number is still Best Rate MB/s divided by 1000.

## 2026-10-04 — Tensor-op GPU check, L2 label, and suite tolerance

- **105/305 device.** The collector exits `[FAIL] no ROCm GPU` when `torch.cuda.is_available()` is false. A missing GPU no longer runs the case on CPU and compares it with a CPU reference.
- **105/205/305/405 relative error.** The label is "Maximum relative L2 error." The key stays `max_rel_error`, and the value stays `||difference|| / ||reference||`.
- **205/405 tolerance.** Every row, including the summary, stores the suite pass percentage in `tolerance_compliance`. The mean is that percentage.

## 2026-10-04 — SDC labels match the buffer check

- **104/304 ECC.** `uncorrected_ecc_errors_count` and `corrected_ecc_errors_count` stay the rocm-smi before/after delta. A RAS table's last two integers on each data row are correctable, then uncorrectable. A table that names those columns and yields no counts is `na (RAS table not parsed)`. The labels are "RAS uncorrectable counter delta" and "RAS correctable counter delta."
- **104/304 buffer size.** `hbm3_coverage_gb` is the allocated int32 buffer in decimal GB, and it is blank when the tensor is on CPU. The label is "Allocated verification buffer, GB."
- **204/404 buffer size.** The label is "Device buffer size, GiB." The key stays `hbm3_coverage_gb` and is still one `cudaMalloc` buffer.
- **Pass rate.** 104/304 is "Even-index int32 verification pass rate" (`even_word_store_pass_rate`). 204/404 is "Fixed-pattern fill/verify pass rate" (`walking_1s_moving_inversion_pass_rate`). Both values stay on a 0–100 scale.

## 2026-10-04 — Stress power, ECC interval, and NVIDIA temperature label

- **103/303 power.** A line counts as GPU power only when it is package power or the watt unit is its own word. The letter `w` inside `power` no longer matches. Each sample keeps the highest draw across GPUs, and the `sustained_` prefix still averages those samples.
- **103/203/303/403 ECC.** `gpu_system_ecc_error_count` is the last numeric sample minus the first, written on every row. A RAS table that says "Uncorrectable Error" without a captured count is `na (RAS table not parsed)`, not 0.
- **203/403 temperature.** The label is "Peak GPU temperature." The key stays `peak_gpu_junction_temp_c`. The reading is still `temperature.gpu`, and `peak_` still publishes the maximum.

## 2026-10-04 — System config labels match the checks

- **101/301 kernel count.** `kernel_driver_mismatch_count` is `uname -r` against `kernel_version` only. The label is "Kernel mismatch count." The amdgpu version stays in driver compliance.
- **101/301 driver compliance.** No `modinfo` version writes `na (in-tree amdgpu has no version)`. A real 0 is allowed by the `compliance` zero-ok hint. The `6` prefix match is unchanged.
- **201/401 package count.** `nvidia-smi` is counted missing only when the command fails. `cuda-toolkit` uses the existing CUDA-major check. Other names still use `dpkg-query`. The key `cuda_package_version_mismatches_count` is unchanged.
- **201/401 permissions.** Only character devices under `/dev/nvidia*` are checked. `/dev/nvidia-caps` is not a permission error. The label is "Device permission error count." The key is unchanged.

## 2026-10-04 — Fresh-VM fixes for 427, 428, 429, 430, and 432

These are generator overlays. The next `create_one_workload.py` run picks them up. Already generated repositories are unchanged.

- **427 / NVIDIA vLLM.** `run_benchmark.sh` for KV-cache, throughput, and token generation prepends `${REPO_ROOT}/.venv/bin` to `PATH`. FlashInfer's sampler JIT runs `ninja`, and `setup.sh` installs that binary into the venv. A CUDA-only `PATH` exited smoke with `FileNotFoundError: ninja` until a later SGLang setup installed apt `ninja-build`.
- **428 / 429 streaming.** A long greedy completion can put two logprob tokens in one SSE event while `usage.completion_tokens` still matches the sum. `record_stream_choice` counts N logprob tokens, including one token whose text is empty, and splits the gap since the previous stamp into N samples. The run fails when the summed count differs from usage, or when a chunk has text and no logprob tokens. The same client change is in the AMD throughput and token-generation overlays.
- **430 / NVIDIA SGLang.** Baseline is the first real `sglang.launch_server`. A cache that only has `consolidated.safetensors` makes SGLang download `model.safetensors.index.json` and then ignore the consolidated file, so the weight list is empty. Baseline and extended run `scripts/prefetch_sglang_model.py` and pass the snapshot directory as `--model-path`. Smoke still uses `scripts/tiny_sglang_server.py`. The same prefetch is on the serving overlay (231/431).
- **432 / RAG.** `find_local_causal_lm` accepts a snapshot only when weights and a non-empty `tokenizer.json` or `tokenizer.model` are present. `tokenizer.model.v3` does not count. If weights are cached without those files, prefetch downloads the tokenizer files instead of skipping the repo. The AMD RAG overlay has the same check.

## 2026-10-03 — vLLM token generation verifies server, model, and tokens

Workloads 129, 229, 329, and 429 now launch real vLLM in every profile and use one unreported request of up to four output tokens before throughput timing. The client verifies `/v1/models` against the configured model, saves `loaded_model_id.txt`, and records that identity in ledger notes. Streaming ITL requires exactly one logprob token per timed SSE chunk and a final count matching `usage.completion_tokens`; ambiguous chunk timing fails instead of being labeled token latency. Equal measured ITL and TPOT values remain valid. Total request completion time now publishes p50 rather than an unstated arithmetic mean. All five metric labels and keys are unchanged.

## 2026-10-03 — vLLM throughput smoke and token-level ITL

Workloads 128, 228, 328, and 428 now launch the configured real vLLM server in every profile; smoke reduces request dimensions rather than substituting `tiny_kv_server.py`. One request of up to four output tokens warms the server before the aggregate throughput timer starts. Streaming requests ask vLLM for logprobs and accept ITL only when every timed SSE chunk maps to exactly one reported output token and the count matches `usage.completion_tokens`; ambiguous inter-chunk timing fails instead of being labeled ITL. Measured ITL is no longer blanked merely because it equals TPOT. End-to-end request latency now publishes p50 instead of an unstated arithmetic mean.

## 2026-10-03 — KV-cache stress uses real vLLM and measured occupancy

Workloads 127, 227, 327, and 427 now launch the configured real vLLM server in every profile; smoke reduces request dimensions instead of substituting `tiny_kv_server.py`. Each sweep sends one unreported warmup request, reports median TTFT/TPOT, and computes decode throughput as all completed post-first tokens divided by one wall-clock decode window from the earliest first token to the latest completion. KV occupancy is sampled every 50 ms while requests are active and the run fails when GiB or percentage remains unavailable. Documented vLLM utilization gauges are accepted only as 0–1 ratios before conversion to percent, preventing a value such as 1.2 from becoming 120%.

## 2026-10-03 — SDXL smoke measures real SDXL

Stable Diffusion XL workloads now load the real SDXL pipeline in every benchmark profile. Smoke retains a short run but enforces at least 256×256 resolution, two denoising steps, and two timed images; TinyDenoiser remains only an explicit setup self-test and the NVIDIA collector refuses to publish it as SDXL. Cold latency starts before pipeline import/loading and ends after the first generated image. Peak memory uses the larger of PyTorch peak allocated and reserved memory and real-SDXL results below 5 GB are rejected. NVIDIA summary throughput is total images divided by total timed image seconds, and peak VRAM is the maximum across passes.

## 2026-10-03 — Memcpy bandwidth regime and seven-slot ledger

Workloads 114, 214, 314, and 414 retain their existing metric labels and keys but now enforce a 256 MiB maximum-transfer floor and at least 10 timed copies, so their maximum-size values measure sustained transfer bandwidth instead of expressing 4 KiB latency as GB/s. NVIDIA's pageable ratio is published only at the maximum transfer size rather than averaged across the sweep. The runtime ledger now has seven metric definition/result pairs, preserving D2D latency (#6) and NVIDIA pageable ratio (#7); existing five-slot ledgers migrate by column name with the two new pairs blank on older rows.

## 2026-10-03 — AMD GUPS L3 miss rate

Workloads 113 and 313 keep metric #5 as `L3 cache miss rate (l3_miss_rate)`, but now compute it from `LLC-load-misses / LLC-loads` rather than generic `cache-misses / cache-references`. The table is at least four times the detected last-level cache, with a 256 MiB fallback floor. Hosts that do not expose both LLC load events report `na (LLC load counters unavailable)` instead of relabeling generic cache events as L3.

## 2026-10-03 — NUMA cache and DRAM measurements

Workloads 110, 210, 310, and 410 keep their existing metric labels and keys. Cache latency now comes from the largest configured non-DRAM tier instead of the smallest working set. The DRAM tier is expanded beyond the detected last-level cache (with a 256 MiB floor), and latency, pointer-chase bandwidth, and cache misses all come from that configured tier and access pattern rather than a separate hardcoded random run. The native harness now honors `num_threads`, builds a complete dependent pointer chain, and computes aggregate useful-load bandwidth instead of multiplying accesses by stride. `per_size.csv` includes cache misses for every measured tier.

## 2026-10-03 — AMD KV-cache GiB from the engine log

Workloads 127 and 327 publish KV-cache GiB as the measured percent times `Available KV cache memory` in `server.log` when the server exports a percent and no byte gauge. A byte gauge still wins. A percent with neither bytes nor that log line is `na (server reported a percent and no byte count)`. No reading at all stays `na (server reported no KV-cache usage)`. Workloads 227 and 427 use the same fallback reason.

## 2026-10-03 — rocBLAS GEMM drops the unpublished L2

Workloads 117 and 317 no longer publish L2 norm error. rocBLAS does not print `norm_error_2`, so that slot was always `na`. CPU reference GFLOPS is slot 5. Workloads 217 and 417 still publish the L2 their collector computes.

## 2026-10-03 — Remote DRAM latency reason

Workloads 109, 209, 309, and 409 print `na (requires a second NUMA node)` for remote DRAM latency when the host has one NUMA node. A blank skipped tier still prints `not measured`.

## 2026-10-03 — Runtime windows for 218, 412, 126/326, and 432

Baseline stays inside 3–5 minutes and extended inside 8–15 minutes. Targets from the latest measured runs are about 4:00 and 11:30.

- **412:** `repetitions` baseline 5 → 1, extended 14 → 3. Measured 17:19 and 52:40.
- **218:** `num_iterations` baseline 168000 → 85000, extended 514000 → 250000. Measured 7:50 and 23:48.
- **126/326:** iteration counts stay. The AMD forward pass stops at 120 seconds baseline and 330 seconds extended (was 300 and 900). The collector still runs two passes, which is why both baselines were about 10:21.
- **432:** `query_count` baseline 220 → 75, extended 680 → 190. Measured 11:44 and about 41:00. Baseline 75 builds the 400-context corpus.

## 2026-10-03 — Prerequisites Python label

The prerequisites paragraph uses the `Python Version` cell as written when that cell already starts with `Python`. A bare version still receives the prefix. Workbook cells stay `Python 3.12.3` and `Python 3.14.4`.

## 2026-10-03 — HPL headline order

Workloads 120, 220, 320, and 420 put time to solution in slot 2 and percent of peak in slot 3. Slot 1 stays sustained FP64 TFLOPS. The peak keys stay `percent_of_gpu_fp64_matrix_peak` on 120/320 and `percent_of_fp64_vector_peak` on 220/420. The 220/420 output-field list and raw-example header now name `percent_of_fp64_vector_peak`.

## 2026-10-03 — Convolution headline order

Workloads 218 and 418 use the same first three roles as 118 and 318. Slot 1 is forward kernel time (`kernel_time_msec`). Slot 2 is forward achieved throughput in TFLOP/s (`tflops_fwd`). Slot 3 is forward memory bandwidth (`memory_bandwidth_gb_s`). Slot 4 stays solver search time (`solver_search_msec`), the sum of `cudnnFind` wall time across the directions run. Keys and collectors are unchanged. 118 and 318 slot 4 remains the forward flop count (`flopcnt`).

## 2026-10-03 — Memcpy key order

Workloads 114, 214, 314, and 414 use `bandwidth_<direction>_gbps` and `latency_<direction>_us`. Directions stay `h2d`, `d2h`, and `d2d`. The pageable ratio key is unchanged.

## 2026-10-03 — Creation fixes from workloads 101–432

The four TEMPLATE_00_97 batches passed after mid-run repairs. Those repairs are now in the generator.

- **Docs.** Missing workbook columns `Execution Summary (Run and Measure)`, `nVidia Porting Instructions (Reference Only)`, `AMD nVidia Applicable`, and `Model Context Protocols` are filled during extraction. Prerequisites and the mermaid diagram are written before any hardware table. `{{Kernel Version}}` uses the profile `kernel_version` when that value is set. Remote logs are printed with replacement characters, and Git Bash path conversion is disabled on Windows.
- **Self-check.** A missing `rg` fails as `ripgrep is not installed`. The remote run installs ripgrep before self-check. A helper named only inside `[[ -f scripts/... ]]` is optional.
- **Remote tree.** `chmod 644` skips `third_party`, `bin`, and `build`. Shell scripts keep the execute bit. An existing `rocblas-bench` is treated as built, and `install.sh` is made executable before it runs. STREAM restores `+x` after `cp`. `.env_reuse_stamp` is written when setup finishes, including when smoke fails later.
- **101/301.** `rocm-smi` and `rocm-core` match Ubuntu 26.04 package names and an `/opt/rocm/bin/rocm-smi` executable. A missing in-tree `amdgpu` version is left blank with mismatch 0.
- **111/211/311/411.** `yaml_get` reads `config/benchmark_config.yaml` with PyYAML, so a folded `stress-ng` command keeps both the `--cpu` and `--cache` invocations.
- **116/316.** The RCCL binary accepts one visible GPU and is rebuilt when `src/rccl_perf.cpp` is newer than `bin/all_reduce_perf`. A one-GPU profile still publishes `na (requires at least two GPUs)`.
- **126/326.** Ubuntu 24.04 installs `jax-rocm7-plugin==0.10.0`. Ubuntu 26.04 keeps the `+rocm7.14.0` wheel. Setup exits unless `jax.devices()` contains a non-CPU device.
- **201/401.** A driver CUDA major newer than the workbook major is not a package mismatch.
- **206 and NVIDIA setup.** `python3` is installed before the interpreter probe on the NVIDIA, CPU/system, vLLM, and SGLang setup paths.
- **205/405 and other locked YAML.** A locked sweep that already matches after numeric normalization is left byte-identical. A real merge refreshes the overlay hash from the file in the repo.
- **327–331.** Ubuntu 26.04 accepts the AMD CDNA vLLM index as well as `wheels.vllm.ai/rocm/`. `sgl-kernel` compiles with `/opt/rocm/bin` first and `/opt/rocm/include` on the include path.
- **Records.** Batch rows use `return_code` and `reason`. `GENERATION_REPORT.md` receives the start, finish, and duration after validation.

## 2026-10-03 — Align AMD and NVIDIA headline metrics

Workbook metric order and keys now match across each vendor pair where the measurement is already the same. Collector columns were renamed with the workbook so a new key still resolves. Rows not listed here were left unchanged.

- **201/401:** driver compliance is slot 3 and VBIOS presence is slot 4. 101/301 are unchanged.
- **102/202/302/402:** the device-visibility count moves to slot 5. Temperature, PCIe width, and PCIe speed occupy slots 2–4.
- **104/304:** ECC keys gain the `_count` suffix. Wall-clock time moves to slot 3 on 104/204/304/404. Coverage bytes and the two pass-rate patterns are unchanged.
- **112/212/312/412:** null-syscall time is microseconds (`lat_syscall_null_us`). Context switch is `context_switch_latency_us`. The 16 MB latency row is selected by size. Memory read is `bw_mem 512m rd`.
- **105/205/305/405:** 205/405 slots 1 and 2 say "across correctness cases". Reference dtype is unchanged.
- **115/215/315/415:** BabelStream keys are `bandwidth_gb_s_copy`, `bandwidth_gb_s_mul`, `bandwidth_gb_s_add`, `bandwidth_gb_s_triad`, and `bandwidth_gb_s_dot`.
- **113/313:** order is giga-updates, update rate, payload GB/s, TLB miss rate, L3 miss rate. The score key is `giga_updates_score`. 213/413 stay at three metrics and publish `updates_sec`.
- **117/317:** headline metrics are achieved TFLOPS, kernel time in milliseconds, minimum operand traffic, rocBLAS `norm_error_1` as `relative_l1_checked_columns`, and `norm_error_2`. rocBLAS does not print an L2 norm, so that cell is `na (rocblas-bench does not report norm_error_2)`. `cpu_gflops` remains slot 6.
- **121/221/321/421:** slot 4 is peak GPU memory and slot 5 is the traffic estimate.
- **122/322:** slot 3 is the nearest-rank p99 (`batch_p99_latency_msec`). Throughput and per-image latency use the mean step time.
- **223/423:** slot 2 publishes the mean step time already used for throughput (`mean_latency_ms`).
- **124/324:** per-image latency key is `per_image_latency_sec`. Peak memory keys are unchanged.
- **125/225/325/425:** step time is `step_time_ms` and token throughput uses one label.
- **127/227/327/427:** shared keys are `output_tokens_per_sec`, `ttft_msec`, `tpot_msec`, `kv_cache_peak_gb`, and `kv_cache_usage_peak_pct`.
- **128/228/328/428 and 129/229/329/429:** the p50 keys use the `*_msec` names.
- **130/330:** the printed list drops completed-request percentage and slot 1 is "E2E latency, ms". The client still records the percentage.

## 2026-10-03 — One-GPU collectives publish na; JAX budget is a warning; H100 stress power limit is 700 W

- **116/216/316/416:** `all_reduce` still runs. On one GPU the three metrics are `na (requires at least two GPUs)` and the run exits 0. A missing binary, non-zero exit, or empty size table still fails. A profile that asks for two or more GPUs and initializes fewer still fails.
- **126/226/326/426 JAX/XLA:** hitting the profile time budget prints `[WARN]` and records the iterations that finished. `requested_iterations` and `completed_iterations` stay in the result. The run fails when the process exits non-zero, emits no RESULT line, or completes zero iterations. Workbook iteration counts are unchanged.
- **203/403:** `power_threshold` is 700 W, the H100 SXM board limit. Mean power above that limit still fails validation. `gpu_load_percent` stays 50. Temperature, thermal slowdown, ECC, and the GPU-load check are unchanged. 103/303 stay at 500 W.
- **Tests:** `tests/test_metric_feedback_updates.py` covers the na string, the two-GPU shortfall failure, and the JAX budget warning.

## 2026-10-02 — Metric feedback follow-up: ten additional correctness improvements

- **104/204/304/404 ECC:** corrected and uncorrected metrics are pre/post deltas. AMD parses exact counter names; NVIDIA records failed loops. Pass rates are passed checks divided by attempted checks, and coverage counts only the verified device buffer.
- **201/301/401 stack validation:** package counts no longer include tool-probe or CUDA-major failures. AMD exposes kernel and driver diagnostics separately, leaves unavailable driver compliance blank, and counts each missing device independently. NVIDIA reports CUDA-major mismatch separately and scores a three-check minimum-driver/userspace/kernel compliance checklist.
- **106/206/306/406 FIO:** the first declared rw/block-size/queue-depth case is the recorded headline. Every matrix result remains available under `case_*` columns, avoiding a mean across incompatible cases.
- **122/222/322/422 ResNet inference:** the largest declared batch is the recorded operating point; every batch retains its own `case_*` metrics. Throughput and latency now describe the same batch.
- **110/210/310/410 NUMA:** unavailable or denied cache-miss counters emit `na (...)`, never zero.
- **126/226/326/426 JAX/XLA:** compilation is timed with `lower(...).compile()` separately from execution, incomplete iteration profiles fail, and output records the analytic FLOP method plus requested/completed iteration counts.
- **220/420 NVIDIA dense LU:** identifies the cuSOLVER Dgetrf/Dgetrs implementation, records requested/actual N and repeats, and uses the FP64 vector peak rather than tensor-core peak.
- **127/227/327/427 vLLM KV:** decode throughput excludes TTFT/prefill; AMD requires byte telemetry for the GiB metric instead of estimating it from utilization and total VRAM.
- **131/231/331/431 SGLang:** ITL percentiles pool individual token gaps across requests instead of taking percentiles over per-request means.
- **Tests:** expanded metric-feedback regression coverage for all ten follow-up changes.

## 2026-10-02 — Metric feedback: preserve keys while correcting collection and aggregation

- **116/216/316/416 collective bandwidth:** RCCL now initializes the requested GPU ranks and both vendors require at least two GPUs. The headline metrics use one defined all-reduce operating point instead of averaging unlike collectives; one-rank runs fail rather than publishing `na` as a measurement.
- **105/205/305/405 tensor correctness:** relative error is a whole-tensor norm ratio, compliance remains elementwise `atol + rtol*abs(reference)`, maxima cover every iteration, failed cases carry error status, and `failure_count` is the integer suite total.
- **112/312 lmbench:** long-form benchmark names now equal the unit-suffixed contract keys, the 16 MB latency row is selected by size, and memory bandwidth uses a 512 MB working set instead of an 8 MB cache-resident buffer.
- **124/224/324/424 SDXL parsing:** run latency is the mean across timed images, throughput is completed images divided by total timed duration, peak VRAM uses `max`, and step time uses all samples instead of the first/last row.
- **106/206/306/406 FIO:** explicit operation mapping prevents `randwrite` from selecting read statistics. Missing IOPS, bandwidth, or failed FIO execution now fails instead of inventing 1 IOPS, 4096-byte bandwidth, or latency percentiles.
- **202/402 NVIDIA health:** emits the exact `pcie_link_speed_gt_s` contract key. **302:** missing temperature remains unmeasured and zero HSA GPU agents is retained as a failed sample.
- **Peak aggregation:** generated parsers apply `max` to observed metric names containing `peak` (except theoretical `percent_of_*peak`). The NVIDIA vLLM KV collector separately takes the maximum `kv_cache_peak_gb` and `kv_cache_usage_peak_pct` across sweeps instead of their mean.
- **Metric binding:** resolution examines later parentheticals, so labels such as `(decode) ... (output_tokens_per_s)` bind to the real key without changing the label.
- **Tests:** added coverage for later-parenthetical key binding and non-leading peak aggregation.

## 2026-10-02 — 111/211/311/411 Linux perf PMU: one collector, same five metrics on AMD and NVIDIA

- **Problem:** the four rows share a workload name, parameters, and run commands, but each vendor had its own collector. 111/311 (`linux-perf-pmu-amd`) published IPC, branch misprediction, cache misses per 1,000 instructions, pipeline stall %, and context switches/s, left them blank with status ok when perf was blocked, and profiled `sleep` when stress-ng was missing. 211/411 (`linux-perf-pmu-nvidia`) published elapsed TSC-or-PMU cycles, child CPU time, CPU utilization, and bogo-ops/s instead; its #1 was PMU cycles summed over every CPU on one host and wall time x TSC frequency on another (not the same unit), its CSV column was `cycles` while the metric key was `elapsed_tsc_or_pmu_cycles`, its optional IPC columns used other names, and it counted a missing branch-misses or stall event as 0. The stall events also differed: AMD asked for `cycle_activity.stalls_total`, which exists only on Intel CPUs (the MI300X VM has an Intel Xeon 8568Y+), NVIDIA asked for `stalled-cycles-frontend/backend`, which Intel does not implement.
- **One `scripts/collect_workload.py`, identical in both components:**
  - Runs each yaml `workload_commands` entry (`{num_cpus}`, `{duration}` substituted) under `perf stat -x, -o <run>/perf_N.csv`, counting cycles, instructions, branches, branch-misses, cache-misses, context-switches, the stall event, and the yaml `event_list` (names perf does not know are dropped and listed in `pmu_events.txt`; it used to be ignored).
  - Metrics: `instructions_per_cycle_ipc` = instructions / cycles; `branch_misprediction_rate` = 100 x branch-misses / branches; `cache_misses_per_1000_instructions`; `pipeline_stall_pct` = 100 x stall cycles / cycles; `context_switches_during_workload_switches_s` = context switches / elapsed seconds (perf, else getrusage).
  - Stall event by CPU vendor: `cycle_activity.stalls_total` (GenuineIntel), `stalled-cycles-backend` (AuthenticAMD and others); `BENCHMARK_PMU_STALL_EVENT` overrides. If it does not count, `pipeline_stall_pct` is `na (no stall-cycle event counted on this CPU ...)`.
  - No PMU: when perf cannot open its events it never starts the workload, so the command runs bare and the four PMU metrics read `na (PMU access denied: perf_event_paranoid=N)`, `na (hardware PMU counters not available on this host)`, or `na (perf not installed for kernel ...)`. Generated `parse_results.py` reports that text in summary.json and the metric summary prints it.
  - Extra columns: raw counts, `pipeline_stall_event`, `pmu_counter_running_pct` (below 100 means perf multiplexed and scaled counters), `context_switches`, `cpu_time_sec`, `cpu_utilization_percent`, `stress_ng_bogo_ops_s`, `pmu_source` (`perf` / `unavailable` / `perf_missing`).
  - Accepts `--num-cpus`, `--workload-commands`, `--event-list`, `--duration` (yaml values when absent), so `run_benchmark.sh` now passes them.
  - Fails the run if stress-ng is missing or a workload exits non-zero.
- **Workbook (111/211/311/411, 14 cells each, 56 total):** the same Metrics on all four (#2 label now "Branch misprediction rate, pct"; keys unchanged for 111/311). Execution Description, Main Goal, Validation Objective, Command Tools, Command Methodology, Command Execution Details, Raw Output Format, Record Granularity, Raw Output Example, Output Fields, Success Criteria, Parser Notes, and Known Runtime Constraints rewritten to match the code (111 said workload_commands was ignored and only `--cpu 1` / `--cache 1` ran; 111/311 said missing counts were floored at 1.0). Parameters sheet and run commands unchanged; `sync_matrix_profile_commands.py --check` passes.
- **`component.json` descriptions, AGENTS.md, `docs/SIBLING_WORKLOAD_NOTES.md`** describe the shared collector.
- **Expect different numbers:** 211/411 results are not comparable with earlier rows (different metrics). 111/311 #4 now uses the vendor-correct stall event, and on an AMD EPYC host may read na where it used to be blank.
- **Tests:** `tests/test_linux_perf_pmu.py` (11, stand-in perf and stress-ng): both components identical; spec keys present; Intel (hybrid `cpu_core/cycles/` name), AMD stall event, missing stall event is na, no PMU, permission denied (workload rerun bare), perf missing, runner flags override yaml, failed workload and missing stress-ng fail. Full suite 88 tests pass. End to end through the generated parser, validator, and metric summary for 211/311/411 with PMU and with na. Real perf on a host with `perf_event_paranoid=4`: denied path, `na (PMU access denied: perf_event_paranoid=4)`, unknown event dropped. **Not yet run on the MI300X or H100 VMs.**

## 2026-10-02 — 203/403 NVIDIA system stress applies real GPU load (cuBLAS GEMM at gpu_load_percent) and its thresholds

- **Problem:** the `system-stress-nvidia` collector started only `stress-ng --cpu` and accepted none of the runner's flags, so `gpu_load_percent`, `cpu_load_percent`, `temp_threshold`, `power_threshold`, `throttle_check`, `ecc_check`, and `poll_interval` were dropped (`run_benchmark.sh` passes a flag only when the collector's `--help` lists it), while the ledger's resolved command still showed them. On the 26.04 H100 SXM VM, 403 baseline (`20261002_134110`) read 0% `utilization.gpu`, ~73 W, and 36-37 C for 200 s: an idle GPU was published as the stress result. Each poll also made two `nvidia-smi` calls and then slept a full second, so polls drifted (seconds 17, 34, 50, ... missing).
- **New `src/gpu_stress.cu` (bin/gpu_stress):** cuBLAS `cublasGemmEx` FP16 GEMM, n=8192, FP32 accumulate, non-zero inputs. Runs GEMMs back to back for `load_percent` of each 100 ms window and idles for the rest, so `utilization.gpu` follows the request. Prints `GPU_LOAD_READY` after warm-up, `GPU_LOAD` per second, and `GPU_LOAD_DONE seconds= gemms= busy_pct= tflops_busy=`. Every CUDA/cuBLAS call is checked; any error exits 2 with the message.
- **New `scripts/build.sh`:** nvcc with `nvcc_arch_flags` (native SASS) and `-lcublas`. 403's `scripts/build.sh` was empty before. **New `scripts/probe_setup.sh`:** setup fails unless `bin/gpu_stress 2 50` reports GEMMs.
- **`scripts/collect_workload.py`:**
  - Accepts `--num-threads`, `--cpu-load-percent`, `--gpu-load-percent`, `--temp-threshold`, `--power-threshold`, `--throttle-check`, `--ecc-check`, `--poll-interval`, `--duration` (yaml values when a flag is absent).
  - Starts `bin/gpu_stress <duration+2> <gpu_load_percent>` and waits for `GPU_LOAD_READY` (120 s limit) before starting `stress-ng --cpu <num_threads> --cpu-load <cpu_load_percent>`, so every sample is inside the load window. Output goes to `gpu_stress.txt`.
  - One `nvidia-smi` call per poll (ECC field included when `ecc_check`), on a fixed `poll_interval` schedule.
  - Fails the run if `bin/gpu_stress` is missing, never reaches READY, exits non-zero, or reports no GEMMs, or if mean `utilization.gpu` is below half of `gpu_load_percent` (minimum 10%).
  - Peak temperature above `temp_threshold`, mean power above `power_threshold`, or a hardware thermal slowdown with `throttle_check` marks every sample `status=error` with the reason; the run parses as `partial` and `--validate` fails. CSV columns and the three metrics are unchanged.
- **`component.json`:** overlays `src/gpu_stress.cu`, `scripts/build.sh`, `scripts/probe_setup.sh`; completeness `closed`.
- **`setup_nvidia_skeleton.sh`:** fails when `src/gpu_stress.cu` is present but `bin/gpu_stress` was not built. **`self_check_generated_repo.sh`:** `src/gpu_stress.cu` must be compiled by `scripts/build.sh`.
- **Workbook (203 row 40, 403 row 112, 16 cells):** Validation Objective, Command Tools Executed, Command Methodology, Command Execution Details, Raw Output Format, Software Framework (cuBLAS-bench removed), Runtime Language; 203 also Execution Description and Main Goal. 403 text no longer promises DCGM, `sensors`, or Xid monitoring, which are not run. No other cell changed.
- **Expect different numbers:** 403 power and temperature now reflect ~50% GEMM load and are not comparable with earlier rows. The default `power_threshold` 500 W and `temp_threshold` 75 C now gate the result. An H100 SXM at 50% duty is expected to stay under both, but that has not been measured.
- **Tests:** `tests/test_system_stress_nvidia.py` runs the collector with stand-in `nvidia-smi`, `stress-ng`, and `bin/gpu_stress`: loaded run ok and `--cpu-load 50` passed; idle GPU, missing binary, and a binary that fails with the PTX error each fail the run; temperature, power, and thermal-slowdown breaches mark samples error. Full suite 77 tests pass. `gpu_stress.cu` compiles and links against CUDA 12 runtime and cuBLAS headers with `-Wall -Wextra`, no warnings, and exits 2 with a message on a host without a GPU. **Not yet run on a GPU.**

## 2026-10-02 — 418 cuDNN convolution builds on CUDA 13.3; 404/415/418 compile native SASS; 404 checks kernel launches

- **Failure (418, Ubuntu 26.04, H100, CUDA 13.3 nvcc only):** smoke/baseline/extended all exited 1 in setup at `run_benchmark.sh` line 163 (`ensure_setup.sh`). Three faults were stacked; each hid the next.
  1. Setup installed the CUDA 12 system cuDNN while nvcc was CUDA 13. Fixed earlier in this template: the skeleton picks cuDNN after nvcc is on `PATH` and pip-installs `nvidia-cudnn-cu13==9.23.2.1` for CUDA 13.
  2. `build.sh` looked for `.venv/.../nvidia/cudnn/lib/libcudnn.so`. The wheel ships only `libcudnn.so.9` (plus `cudnn.h` under `nvidia/cudnn/include`), so the build stopped with "CUDA 13 nvcc requires the venv cu13 cuDNN" even with the wheel installed. The include directory was never passed either, and `-lcudnn` needs the unversioned name.
  3. With those fixed, `bin/cudnn_conv` stopped at its first fill kernel: "the provided PTX was compiled with an unsupported toolchain". Without `-gencode`, nvcc emits an old default arch plus PTX the driver must JIT; this driver is older than the 13.3 toolkit and refuses it.
- **`cudnn-convolution-nvidia/files/scripts/build.sh`:** on CUDA 13 the venv cuDNN is the directory that has `lib/libcudnn.so.9` and `include/cudnn.h`. Build adds `-I<wheel>/include`, links `lib/libcudnn.so -> libcudnn.so.9` in the venv, and passes rpath with `-Xlinker -rpath -Xlinker`. CUDA 12 path unchanged.
- **`scripts/templates/setup_nvidia_skeleton.sh`:** the "is the cu13 wheel installed" check looks for `libcudnn.so.9` (it looked for `libcudnn.so` and reinstalled the wheel on every setup).
- **`scripts/lib/nvcc_glibc_throw.sh`: new `nvcc_arch_flags`.** Fills `NVCC_ARCH_FLAGS` with `-gencode arch=compute_XX,code=[sm_XX,compute_XX]` from `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=compute_cap`, falling back to the `/proc/driver/nvidia` model (B200/GB200, H100/H200/GH200, L40/Ada, A100/A800). `BENCHMARK_CUDA_ARCH` overrides. Unknown GPU: no flags and a `[WARN]`. This is the block 415 already carried inline.
- **Build scripts using it:** `cudnn-convolution-nvidia` (418), `sdc-ecc-nvidia` (404, previously had no arch flags), `babelstream-hbm-nvidia` (415, inline copy removed). cuBLAS, memcpy, NCCL, and HPL launch no kernels of their own and are unchanged.
- **404 false pass:** `src/ecc_walk.cu` checked only `cudaDeviceSynchronize`, which does not report a rejected launch. On the 26.04 VM the 20 s walk could loop with no kernel running and publish 0 mismatches / 100% pass (ledger `404_20261002_125642`, 20.7 s). Each launch is now followed by `cudaGetLastError()`; a rejected launch exits 2 before the `loops=` line. `collect_workload.py` reports that exit code and ecc_walk's error text (it said "host RAM was not used").
- **Tests:** `tests/test_nvidia_build_contracts.py` (no GPU needed): every component `src/*.cu` with `__global__` kernels has a `build.sh` that calls `nvcc_arch_flags` and passes `NVCC_ARCH_FLAGS` to every nvcc line; every kernel launch is followed by `cudaGetLastError` within 5 lines; the cuDNN build looks for `libcudnn.so.9` and `cudnn.h`; the skeleton check uses `libcudnn.so.9`; `nvcc_arch_flags` output for a stub `nvidia-smi` (9.0 -> sm_90), the override, and the unknown-GPU warning.
- **Checked:** the 418 build and `probe_setup.sh` on the H100 VM with the equivalent inline flags: `-gencode arch=compute_90,code=[sm_90,compute_90]`, fwd / bwd_data / bwd_weights `status=ok`. Full unit suite passes (68 tests). Not yet run on the VM: the shared-helper build scripts, the 404 and 415 rebuilds, and a full smoke pass from a fresh generation.

## 2026-10-01 — 130/230/330/430 SGLang prompt-response: real cache-hit rate, completed-request rate, decode rate, server token counts

- **Server launch (`sglang-prompt-response-amd` and `-nvidia` `run_benchmark.sh`):** baseline/extended add `--enable-cache-report`, so SGLang returns `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens` on each completion. Neither script started SGLang with `--enable-metrics` either, so the old `/metrics` fallback found nothing and real runs published a "measured" 0.0% hit rate.
- **`scripts/prompt_response_client.py` (one file, now identical on both vendors):**
  - RadixAttention hit rate = total cached prompt tokens / total prompt tokens over successful requests. The `/metrics` scrape is removed (it summed label series, multiplied values <= 1.5 by 100, and returned 0.0 when nothing was found). No cached counts (e.g. smoke's stand-in server) -> `na (server reported no cached-token counts)`. Prompts share a common first half by design, so about 50% is expected once the cache is warm.
  - Completed request percentage = successful / attempted requests. Each request is wrapped in try/except: a failed request becomes a `status=error` row with the error message instead of stopping the run. It was hard-coded to 100.0. The client exits 1 only if every request fails.
  - Output token rate is the decode rate, (output tokens - 1) / (end-to-end - TTFT); it was output tokens / end-to-end, which charged prefill and TTFT to generation. Without streaming, TTFT and the rate read `na (requires streaming)` (TTFT was blank).
  - Output tokens come from the server's `usage.completion_tokens` (streaming requests now send `stream_options.include_usage`), else the streamed text-chunk count. Streamed responses carried no usage, so the count fell back to `max_tokens` (3870 at baseline) and overstated the rate when a reply stopped early. TTFT now starts at the first chunk that contains text.
  - New columns `prompt_tokens`, `cached_tokens`, `error_message`.
- **SGLang `parse_results.py` overlay (`sglang-prompt-parser-amd`, `sglang-prompt-response-nvidia`):** means, percentiles, and statistics use successful requests only; client-recorded failures lower the completed percentage without failing the run (the run fails if no request succeeded or a successful row is invalid). A metric with no number reads its `na (...)` text in summary.json (it used to become 0.0 or disappear) and NULL in SQLite.
- **Workbook (130/230/330/430):** #3 label "Output token generation rate (decode), tokens/s"; methodology, raw format, granularity, example, fields, success, and parser-notes cells rewritten (130/330 said the hit rate was hard-coded 1.0); 430 objective/tools no longer mention bench_serving (35 cells).
- **Not changed:** metric keys, prompts, request count, run duration.
- **Checked:** against the smoke server and a stand-in that reports cached tokens and fails one request, through the parser and metric summary: 75% completed, 33.3% hit rate (0 + 32 + 32 of 3 x 64 prompt tokens), na texts for no-cache / no-streaming, client exit 1 and run status error when every request fails. Not run on real SGLang.

## 2026-10-01 — 228/229/428/429 vLLM serving: summary-only raw_results.csv, real percentiles, server token counts (and 128/129/328/329)

- **`vllm-throughput-nvidia` and `vllm-token-generation-nvidia` `scripts/benchmark_serving.py` (228/229/428/429):** per-request rows now go to `requests.csv` (`request_index`, `status`, `output_tokens`, `request_output_tokens_per_sec`, `ttft_msec`, `tpot_msec`, `itl_mean_msec`, `end_to_end_request_latency_msec`). `raw_results.csv` holds only the run summary, twice (the harness needs two rows). Before, the per-request rows (each with its own single-request rate, and its single TTFT/TPOT/ITL copied into p50/p95/p99) were averaged together with the summary row, so throughput came out about 4-5x low (smoke test: 1130 tok/s published vs a true 4760) and "p50" was a mean.
- **ITL percentiles (all four collectors):** taken over every inter-token gap of every request, not over each request's mean gap.
- **Output token count (all four collectors):** requests set `stream_options.include_usage` and use the server's `usage.completion_tokens`, else the number of text chunks, else the requested length. A chunk can carry several tokens, so counting chunks undercounts.
- **`vllm-throughput-amd` and `vllm-token-generation-amd` (128/129/328/329):** TPOT = (end-to-end - TTFT) / (output tokens - 1); it divided by all output tokens. NVIDIA already used tokens - 1. Their `raw_results.csv` layout was already summary-only and is unchanged.
- **Workbook:** 228/229/428/429 Raw Output Format, Record Granularity, and Parser Notes describe the two summary rows, `requests.csv`, the percentile definitions, and TPOT; 128/129/328/329 Parser Notes drop the stale "non-streaming" / "itl duplicates ttft" text (16 cells).
- **Not changed:** metric keys and labels, server launch flags, run duration.
- **Checked:** all four collectors against the smoke server end to end through the generated parser and metric summary; the NVIDIA published throughput equals the run summary (5599 tok/s on the test host) and p50 values are true percentiles.

## 2026-10-01 — 127/327 KV cache stress: standard TPOT, GiB, na instead of blank

- **`vllm-kvcache-amd/scripts/benchmark_serving.py`:** same TPOT and unit fixes as 227/427: TPOT = (end-to-end - TTFT) / max(output tokens - 1, 1) with output tokens from `usage.completion_tokens` (`stream_options.include_usage`), not the mean gap between stream chunks; KV bytes, block-based KV size, and rocm-smi total VRAM in bytes are divided by 1024^3 (GiB) instead of 1e9. With no KV reading (smoke's stand-in server has no KV gauges), #4/#5 read `na (server reported no KV-cache usage)` instead of blank.
- **Workbook (127/327):** #4 label "KV-cache HBM usage, GiB"; Output Fields lists the real metric keys and the TPOT/GiB/smoke notes (4 cells).
- **Checked:** against the AMD smoke server end to end through the generated parser and metric summary.

## 2026-10-01 — 227/427 KV cache stress: no fake smoke KV numbers, standard TPOT, GiB, #3 renamed

- **`vllm-kvcache-nvidia/scripts/tiny_kv_server.py` (smoke only):** no longer serves constant `vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc 0.12` / `kv_cache_usage_bytes 128849018` gauges or prints "GPU KV cache usage: 12%" / "Available KV cache memory: 1.0 GiB" log lines. Smoke #4 and #5 now read `na (server reported no KV-cache usage)` instead of 12% and 0.129 GB.
- **`benchmark_serving.py`:** TPOT = (end-to-end - TTFT) / max(output tokens - 1, 1), with output tokens from the server's `usage.completion_tokens` (requested via `stream_options.include_usage`), else the chunk count. It used to be the mean gap between stream chunks (per chunk, not per token; the whole post-TTFT time with fewer than two chunks). Peak KV bytes are divided by 1024^3 (GiB, the unit of vLLM's "Available KV cache memory" that the log-based path multiplies by) instead of 1e9. A missing KV reading is the na text, not blank; the summary row carries `kv_cache_usage_peak_pct`.
- **#3 renamed:** key `time_per_output_token_tpot_under_high_kv_pressure_msec` -> `tpot_msec` (the run never forces high KV occupancy; #5 shows what it reached). #4 label is "GiB".
- **Workbook (227/427):** Metrics, raw examples, output fields, methodology, and constraints cells updated (8 cells).
- **Not changed:** run duration, server launch flags, and AMD 127/327 (its own collector; same chunk-gap TPOT and 1e9 division, no fake smoke gauges).
- **Checked:** collector against the real smoke server end to end through the generated parser and metric summary (TPOT 1.23 ms for 16 tokens at ~1 ms/chunk; #4/#5 print the na reason).

## 2026-10-01 — 126/326 JAX XLA: vocab_size parameter (32000, as 226/426)

- **Workbook:** 126 and 326 gain `vocab_size` as Parameter_11 (Workload_Definitions BD27/BD99) and a `vocab_size` row (32000 smoke/baseline/extended) in Parameters_SmokeBaselineExtend (rows 1258-1259). Smoke/baseline/extended commands end with `--vocab-size 32000`; `sync_matrix_profile_commands.py --check` passes for all 128 workloads. E27/E99 describe it and the AS27/AS99 "vocab_size is 128 here" note is removed. Generated 126 config now has `vocab_size: 32000`, which `collect_jax_xla.py` passes to the shared forward-pass script, so all four JAX workloads run the same model.
- **Not changed:** `config/workload_parameters.yaml`. `generate_workload_parameters.py` already fails against the current workbook (it treats "-" Parameter cells as parameters), independent of this change.

## 2026-10-01 — 126/226/326/426 JAX XLA: one real transformer on both vendors

- **`jax-xla-amd` (126/326):** now ships the same `gpu-bench-jax-xla-forwardpass.py` and `collect_jax_xla.py` as `jax-xla-nvidia`; `collect_workload.py` is a thin adapter that copies `raw_results.csv` to the harness raw file. The old AMD collector timed a `tanh(x @ W)` stack (no embedding, attention, MLP, or output projection), reported its positions as tokens and its FLOPs as transformer TFLOPS, ignored dtype and num_heads, and fell back to PyTorch (still labeled JAX, `rocm:0`) when JAX failed.
- **`gpu-bench-jax-xla-forwardpass.py` (all four):** TFLOPS now includes the output projection (2·b·s·h·vocab). Each timed chunk size is compiled before timing (the first chunk's JIT compile used to land in the timed window: smoke latency 105 ms -> 0.085 ms on a CPU test). Peak memory falls back to nvidia-smi or rocm-smi, then `na (peak memory not reported)` instead of the output tensor size + 0.01 GB. `collect_jax_xla.py` accepts `peak_hbm_gb=na` with a `PEAK_NA` reason line.
- **Workbook:** the same five Metrics on all four (`forward_latency_msec`, `tokens_per_sec`, `tflops` "full forward pass", `jit_compile_msec`, `peak_hbm_gb`); description, objective, tools, methodology, format, example, fields, success, notes, and constraints cells rewritten (47 cells). 126/326 note that vocab_size is 128 there (226/426 pass 32000).
- **Not changed:** Software Framework cells; attention is single-head over the full hidden size (num_heads only sets head_dim), as before.
- **Checked on CPU JAX 0.10.2** (GPU lookup shimmed): AMD adapter -> collector -> generated parser/validator/printer prints all five; FLOPs match the formula. Not run on a GPU.

## 2026-10-01 — 124/224/324/424 SDXL: real denoising step time and cold first-image latency

- **#4 `step_time_ms` (`sdxl-diffusers-amd` and `-nvidia` `scripts/infer_sdxl.py`):** timed with diffusers `callback_on_step_end` (GPU-synchronized timestamp at the end of every step); the value is (last - first) / (steps - 1) per batch call, averaged over batches. It used to be pipeline time / steps (text encoders, VAE decode, and PIL conversion charged to every step), and on AMD also divided by the batch size. The real-model path needs `num_inference_steps` >= 2 (baseline 30, extended 50); smoke's tiny stand-in already timed only its denoising loop and is unchanged.
- **#5 `first_image_latency_s`:** the warmup call is now one full image at the yaml step count and is timed (cold: includes one-time kernel compile / autotune). It used to be an untimed 2-step warmup, after which AMD timed an extra already-warm image and NVIDIA used the first timed image. AMD no longer runs that extra image; NVIDIA's warmup grows from 2 steps to the full count.
- **Workbook:** #4 "Denoising step time per batch, ms", #5 "First-image latency, cold" on all four; Output Fields cells describe the timing.
- **Checked with a fake diffusers pipeline (batch 2, 10 steps):** step time 20 ms (old formula: 12.6), first image 0.20 s, warmup is a single full image, AMD runs no extra solo image. Callback signature checked against diffusers 0.40.0. Not run on a GPU.

## 2026-10-01 — 122/222/322/422 ResNet-50 inference: GPU utilization sampled during the timed loop

#4 GPU utilization was read once, after the timed loop had finished and synchronized, so it reported an idle GPU (about 0%). NVIDIA returned 0.0 when nvidia-smi failed.

- **`resnet50-inference-amd/scripts/collect_workload.py` (122/322) and `resnet50-inference-nvidia/scripts/gpu-bench-resnet50-pytorch-inference.py` (222/422):** new `UtilSampler` reads utilization every 0.1 s on a background thread during the timed iterations; a reading counts only if it finished before the loop ended. The metric is the mean of those readings, or `na (timed loop too short to sample)` / `na (<tool> gave no utilization reading)`. AMD reads amdgpu `gpu_busy_percent` from sysfs (highest AMD card) with rocm-smi / amd-smi as fallback; NVIDIA uses nvidia-smi `utilization.gpu`.
- **`collect_resnet50_infer.py` (222/422):** accepts `gpu_utilization_percent=na` in the RESULT line plus a `UTIL_NA batch_size=... reason=na (...)` line; the summary averages only batches with a number.
- **122/322 #5 peak GPU memory:** `torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()` before each batch size (every later batch reported the largest peak so far). NVIDIA already reset it.
- **Workbook:** 122/222/322/422 notes and tools cells describe the sampling (122 had said util is hard-coded 1.0; 322/422 described an "inference server and training for 5min"). Raw output examples left as recorded.
- **Checked:** sampler with fast, slow, and failing readers (mean / too-short / no-reading); NVIDIA wrapper with an na batch and a numeric batch. Not run on a GPU.

## 2026-10-01 — 119/219/319/419 PyTorch microkernels: shared scripts, six separate GEMM/Conv2d metrics

- **`torch-micro-amd` (119/319):** now ships the same `gemm.py`, `conv2d.py`, and `collect_torch_micro.py` as `torch-micro-nvidia`; `collect_workload.py` is a thin adapter that runs `collect_torch_micro.py` and copies its `raw_results.csv` to the harness raw file. The old AMD collector wrote 1.0 with status ok when a value was missing or a script failed, averaged GEMM and Conv2d into one latency/TFLOPS/traffic value (e.g. 108 and 1.4 TFLOPS -> ~55), counted Conv2d FLOPs without the x2 and bytes as input only, and ignored yaml dtype.
- **`collect_torch_micro.py` (all four):** metrics are `gemm_time_usec`, `gemm_tflops`, `gemm_bandwidth_gb_s`, `conv_time_usec`, `conv_tflops`, `conv_bandwidth_gb_s`. Removed `mean_minimum_traffic_gb_s` (averaged GEMM and Conv2d bandwidth) and `gemm_throughput_tflops` (duplicate of `gemm_tflops`). A missing value now fails with a message instead of a KeyError.
- **Workbook:** the same six Metrics on 119/219/319/419; format, granularity, example, fields, success, and notes cells rewritten for all four; 119 description/methodology (hard-coded fp16 and batch size) and 419 description/tools/details ("PyTorch-ROCm TorchBench", "Git provided TorchBench scripts") corrected.
- **Checked with stub kernels:** AMD adapter -> collector -> generated parser/validator/printer prints all six; a missing value exits 1. Not run on a GPU.

## 2026-10-01 — 117/317 run rocblas-bench; 217/417 achieved_compute_tflops found

- **`rocblas-gemm-amd/scripts/collect_workload.py` (117/317):** now runs the repository-local `rocblas-bench` (built by the rocblas-clients-build mixin, `third_party/rocBLAS/build/release/clients/staging`, or `ROCBLAS_BENCH`) with the yaml dtype, M/N/K, transposes, alpha/beta, lda/ldb/ldc, `warmup_iters` -> `--cold_iters`, `num_iterations` -> `-i`, `norm_check` -> `-v`, and `-f gemm` (`gemm_strided_batched` when batch_count > 1). Values are read by name from its `rocblas-Gflops` CSV header. It fails if rocblas-bench is missing, exits non-zero, or prints no row. Before, it timed `torch.matmul` in float32 and wrote it under rocblas-bench-like names; rocblas-bench was compiled but never run.
- **117/317 metrics:** #1 rocBLAS GEMM throughput, GFLOPS (`rocblas_gflops`); #2 Time per GEMM call, us (`rocblas_gemm_us`, rocblas-bench's `us`); #3 CPU reference GFLOPS (`cpu_gflops`); #4 Relative error vs CPU reference (`norm_error_1`). #2 used to be NOT FOUND (column `us`). With norm_check=0, #3/#4 read `na (norm_check is 0)`.
- **`cublas-gemm-nvidia/scripts/collect_cublas_gemm.py` (217/417):** CSV column `tflops` renamed `achieved_compute_tflops`, so #1 is found (it was NOT FOUND). Value unchanged; the harness RESULT line still prints `tflops=`.
- **Workbook:** 117/317 Metrics and description/objective/tools/methodology/format/example/fields/success/notes/constraints cells rewritten for rocblas-bench (117 had said "This does not execute rocblas-bench"). 217 raw example header and execution details use `achieved_compute_tflops`; 417 raw example RESULT lines now show the binary's real field names (`memory_bandwidth_gb_s=`, `norm_error_1=`). Workload names unchanged.
- **Not changed:** Software Framework cells (117/317 still list PyTorch-ROCm, so setup still installs PyTorch, now unused by this collector).
- **Checked with a fake rocblas-bench:** command line, CSV, generated parser, and metric summary (`rocblas_gflops=101361`, `rocblas_gemm_us=1355.93`, ...; na text with norm_check=0). Not run on a real MI300X.

## 2026-10-01 — 116/216/316/416 RCCL/NCCL: "na (requires at least two GPUs)" on one GPU

On one GPU nothing crosses a GPU-to-GPU link: bus bandwidth is meaningless, algorithm bandwidth is a local copy, and latency is library call overhead. These metrics now read `na (requires at least two GPUs)` instead of a number or a blank.

- **Generated `parse_results.py` (`scripts/materialize_generated_harness.py`):** a metric column with no numbers whose rows all hold the same `na (<reason>)` text is reported in summary.json as that text (it used to vanish). `print_metric_summary.py` prints it. Generated `validate_results.py` skips thresholds on such a value instead of crashing on `float()`.
- **`nccl-bandwidth-nvidia/scripts/collect_workload.py` (216/416):** busbw, algbw, and latency are the na text when the communicator has fewer than two GPUs (the count `nccl_bw` actually used). Before, busbw was blank and algbw/latency were reported. Unchanged at two or more GPUs.
- **`rccl-bandwidth-amd/scripts/collect_workload.py` (116/316):** `rccl_perf.cpp` always uses a one-rank communicator on GPU 0, so all three metrics are the na text on every host. The five collectives still run, and the run now fails if a binary is missing, exits non-zero, or prints no size line (it used to write 1.0 with status ok). If the program gains multiple ranks, bandwidth is taken at the largest size and latency at the smallest (it used to keep only the last line). Transcripts go to `rccl_<collective>.txt`; new columns `num_gpus`, `bytes`. `rccl_perf.cpp` unchanged.
- **Workbook:** 116/316 Metrics now match 216/416 (`... at max message size`, `Latency at min message size`). Description, objective, methodology, format, example, fields, success, notes, and constraints cells for all four rows rewritten to match the code (they claimed every AMD binary runs all-reduce, a 1.0 fallback, last-line parsing, NVIDIA "min_bytes only", and nccl-tests/MPI on 416).
- **Correction to the findings list:** the five AMD binaries are copies, but each runs the collective named by its file name (argv[0]), not all-reduce.
- **Checked:** stubbed AMD and NVIDIA runs, generated parser/validator/printer end to end (prints `busbw_gb_s=na (requires at least two GPUs)`, validation passes), NVIDIA with 2 fake GPUs still reports numbers, AMD failure path exits 1.

## 2026-10-01 — 114/214/314/414 memcpy: latency at min size, bandwidth at max size, per direction

#4 Transfer latency was the mean time per copy over every transfer size (1 KB to 1 GB), so the 1 GB copies (milliseconds) swamped it; 214/414 also kept H2D only. 214/414 #1–#3 were means over every size, so small, latency-bound copies pulled the bandwidth down.

- **`hipmemcpy-bandwidth-amd/scripts/parse_results.py` (114/314):** new `add_min_size_direction_latency` writes `latency_us_h2d`, `latency_us_d2h`, `latency_us_d2d` = time per copy at each direction's smallest transfer size (the twin of the existing max-size `bandwidth_gbps_<dir>`). Collector and `hip_memcpy_bw.cpp` unchanged.
- **`cuda-memcpy-nvidia/scripts/collect_workload.py` (214/414):** `h2d/d2h/d2d_bandwidth_gb_s` are written on the max_bytes row only and new `h2d/d2h/d2d_latency_us` on the min_bytes row only; other rows are blank, so the parser's mean (which skips blanks) is that one measurement. `transfer_latency_us` is removed. Per-size output stays in `memcpy_<kind>_<size>.txt`. `cuda_memcpy.cu` unchanged.
- **Workbook:** Metrics for 114/314 are #1–#3 bandwidth at max size and #4–#6 H2D/D2H/D2D latency at min size; 214/414 the same plus #7 pageable ratio (bandwidth labels "at max transfer size", not "Mean"). Output Fields, Parser Notes (114/314 also drop the stale "falls back to 1024-byte rows"), 214/414 Raw Output Example and 214 Execution Description updated.
- **Checked with stubs:** NVIDIA 1 KB–1 GB sweep: H2D bandwidth 16.5 -> 25.0 GB/s, latency 14,333 -> 2.04 us (fake device). AMD parser: `latency_us` blind mean 4,774 us vs `latency_us_h2d/d2h/d2d` 10.0/11.0/6.0 us.

## 2026-10-01 — 110/210/310/410 NUMA cache sweep: same four metrics on all four

- **Workbook Metrics, 210 (I47) and 410 (I119):** now the same as 110/310: #1 Cache-tier latency, #2 Local DRAM latency, #3 Local DRAM pointer-chase bandwidth, #4 Cache misses/sec. 210 drops #5 Remote NUMA node latency and #6 Cross-socket NUMA ratio; 410 gains #4.
- **Not changed:** `numa-cache-collector` still writes `remote_numa_node_latency_nsec` and `cross_socket_numa_penalty_ratio` to the raw file on all four; they are just not listed metrics. Other 210/410 description cells were left as they are.

## 2026-10-01 — 208/408 iperf3: jitter, packet loss and retransmits no longer halved

- **`iperf3-nvidia/files/scripts/collect_workload.py`:** `udp_jitter_ms` and `packet_loss_rate` are written on the UDP row only and `tcp_retransmit_count` on the TCP row only; the other row is blank. They were written on both rows (0.0 on the protocol that does not measure them), and the parser's mean over a TCP row and a UDP row halved #3, #4, and #5. Blanks are skipped by the mean. This matches `iperf3-amd` (108/308), which already did this.
- **Workbook:** #4 label is now `Packet loss, percent (packet_loss_rate)` in I9, I45, I81, I117 (the value is iperf3 `lost_percent`, so 1.5 means 1.5%). The key is unchanged. 208/408 Parser and Normalization Notes (Y45, Y117) no longer say "TCP fields may be copied onto UDP rows".
- **Workbook, stale text:** Validation Objective for 308 (K81) and 408 (K117) said "NIC ... between VMs"; they now match 108 and 208 (loopback on one host; 408 notes `BENCHMARK_IPERF_PEER`). K9/K81 reworded to "over loopback (127.0.0.1) on one host. This is not a NIC or VM-to-VM test." Parser and Normalization Notes for 108 (Y9) and 308 (Y81) drop "UDP throughput may be floored at 1e-6 Gb/s" (the collector has no floor) and say which row each metric is on.

## 2026-10-01 — 108/208/308/408 iperf3: #2 labeled as loopback

- **Workbook (Metrics, cells I9, I45, I81, I117):** `#2: UDP throughput (udp_throughput_gbps)` is now `#2: UDP loopback throughput (udp_throughput_gbps)`. The client connects to 127.0.0.1 (AMD always; NVIDIA unless `BENCHMARK_IPERF_PEER` is set), so #2, like #1 TCP loopback throughput, measures the host's loopback path, not the NIC. The key is unchanged, so no column, collector, or parser changes.

## 2026-10-01 — ROCm setup reloads the amdgpu driver instead of rebooting

First-time ROCm setup used to reboot once after the driver/firmware install. It now reloads the driver in place and reboots only when the reload cannot be verified.

- **Step 02 is `apt-get upgrade -y`** (was `apt upgrade -y`) in `scripts/lib/rocm_install_24_04.sh` and `rocm_install_26_04.sh`. `apt-get upgrade` never installs new packages, so a new Linux kernel is kept back and the running kernel stays the one in use. Install kernel updates separately when wanted.
- **New `scripts/lib/amdgpu_reload.sh` (`amdgpu_reload_instead_of_reboot dkms|firmware`),** sourced by `scripts/lib/rocm_install.sh`. It runs `update-initramfs -u`, `modprobe -r amdgpu`, `modprobe amdgpu`, waits until every AMD GPU PCI device is a KFD compute node, and on 24.04 checks that the loaded amdgpu is the DKMS build under `/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/updates/`. modprobe runs with a deadline, so a stuck unload cannot hang setup. Protected file.
- **`rocm_install_runtime` (24.04 step 12, 26.04 step 10):** saves `stage3`, tries the reload, and on success clears the stage and returns (status step `sudo modprobe -r amdgpu && sudo modprobe amdgpu`). On failure it reboots exactly as before and the systemd resume service continues setup. 24.04 reloads onto AMD's DKMS driver; 26.04 reloads the in-tree driver so it loads the new `amdgpu-dkms-firmware` files.
- **Fallback to reboot when:** `ROCM_RELOAD_INSTEAD_OF_REBOOT=0`, no AMD GPU on PCI, amdgpu in use, (24.04) no DKMS build for the running kernel, modprobe fails or times out (`AMDGPU_UNLOAD_TIMEOUT` 180 s, `AMDGPU_LOAD_TIMEOUT` 600 s), fewer GPUs than PCI devices within `AMDGPU_INIT_WAIT` (300 s), or (24.04) the loaded module is not the DKMS build.
- **`scripts/templates/setup_rocm_reboot_skeleton.sh`:** first-run notice and `--help` describe the reload. New `grant_gpu_access_this_session` after `rocm_add_repository`: a non-root user just added to `render`/`video` (groups apply at next login, which a reload no longer forces) gets an ACL on `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri/*` for the current boot; `acl` added to the base package list. If that fails, setup says to log out and back in or run `newgrp render`.
- **Not changed:** the `wall` completion message (`setup.sh now complete`) and the systemd resume service, both still needed for the fallback reboot and for loops that redirect output. `config/platform_policy.yaml` keeps `reboots: 1` as the upper bound.
- **Docs:** `docs/rocm-reboot-install-contract.md` (new "Driver Reload Instead Of Reboot" section), AGENTS.md, `docs/generation-workflow.md` (also drops the stale "two expected reboots"), `config/platform_policy.yaml` notes.
- **`scripts/self_check_generated_repo.sh`:** `scripts/lib/noninteractive_root.sh` and `scripts/lib/amdgpu_reload.sh` are required files (both are sourced by `rocm_install.sh`).
- **Tests:** new `tests/test_amdgpu_reload.py` (15 stubbed tests: success paths, every fallback, and the install branch on both Ubuntu versions).
- **Not yet run on a real VM.** Supersedes the operator note in the entry below: when the reload works, first-time 26.04 setup no longer reboots.

## 2026-10-01 — Setup no longer hangs on sudo's pty when output is redirected (26.04 loop hang)

`bash run_benchmark.sh --smoke >> log 2>&1` on a fresh Ubuntu 26.04 VM stopped forever in workload 301's automatic setup: `sudo amdgpu-install` -> `apt-get` ran on a pty that sudo created (`Defaults use_pty`, stdin still the SSH terminal), apt-get restored that terminal after installing, the kernel stopped it with SIGTTOU, and nothing resumed it. Ctrl-C did not reach it.

- **New `scripts/lib/noninteractive_root.sh` (`run_noninteractive_root`):** runs the command directly when root, through `sudo` otherwise; replaces a terminal stdin with `/dev/null` (pipes and heredocs kept); ignores SIGTTOU/SIGTTIN in the command; defaults `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`; accepts leading `VAR=value` arguments like sudo. Sourced by `scripts/lib/rocm_install.sh` and the ROCm setup skeleton. Protected file.
- **`scripts/lib/rocm_install_26_04.sh` (21) and `rocm_install_24_04.sh` (29):** every executed `sudo` is now `run_noninteractive_root` (amdgpu-install, apt/apt-get, tee/gpg/apt-key pipelines, depmod, usermod, mkdir, make install, reboot). Status-log text is unchanged. Line endings preserved (26.04 file is CRLF).
- **`scripts/templates/setup_rocm_reboot_skeleton.sh`:** `run_privileged` calls `run_noninteractive_root`; the bare `apt-get` installs for lmbench, fio, iperf3, stress-ng, and linux-tools go through `run_privileged`.
- **`scripts/ensure_setup.sh`:** automatic setup runs `bash setup.sh --assume-yes </dev/null`, so nothing under it can inherit the caller's terminal.
- **Resume service:** `.setup_state` is written (after `scripts/build.sh`) before `cleanup_resume_service`. When setup runs as the resume service (`--resume-from-service`), cleanup disables the unit with `--no-reload` and removes the file without `systemctl daemon-reload`. The reload had reloaded the running unit without `TimeoutStartSec=infinity`, and systemd SIGTERMed setup.sh before `.setup_state` (26.04 VM, 13:53:13).
- **Docs:** AGENTS.md, `docs/host-prerequisite-contract.md`, `docs/generation-workflow.md`, and checklist 3.27 require `run_privileged` / `run_noninteractive_root` instead of raw `sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get`.
- **Operator note:** first-time ROCm setup on 26.04 reboots once (firmware). Run `bash setup.sh --assume-yes` in each repo before starting a multi-workload loop; otherwise the loop's first workload triggers that reboot. Loops should also pass `</dev/null` to `run_benchmark.sh`.
- **Not changed:** `/etc/sudoers`; NVIDIA/CPU skeletons (no sudo); `sglang-*-nvidia` overlays (`SUDO=sudo` only when not root).

## 2026-10-01 — 109/209/309/409 multichase: #5 Remote DRAM latency kept on all four, shown when not measured

All four workloads use the same `multichase-numa-amd` collector. #5 was missing from the 409 row only, and the 209 row still described an older harness that bound every tier, including remote_dram, to NUMA node 0.

- **`multichase-numa-amd/files/scripts/collect_multichase.py`:** when remote_dram cannot run (fewer than two NUMA nodes from `numactl --hardware`, or `--membind=1` not permitted) it writes a `remote_dram` row with blank `latency_ns` and the reason in `error_message`, instead of dropping the tier. The "at least two samples" check counts measured tiers only. On two or more nodes remote_dram still runs with `--cpunodebind=0 --membind=1`.
- **`scripts/materialize_generated_harness.py` (generated `parse_results.py`):** when a pivoted tier/benchmark/direction group has no value for a column that is pivoted, `summary.json` records that key as `"not measured"` instead of omitting it.
- **`scripts/print_metric_summary.py`:** `not measured` values are printed (e.g. `#5: Remote DRAM latency, ns (latency_ns_remote_dram); latency_ns_remote_dram=not measured`) instead of the line being omitted. A metric with no column at all (NOT FOUND) is still not printed.
- **Workbook rows 109 (10), 209 (46), 309 (82), 409 (118):** 409 Metrics gains #5, so all four Metrics cells are identical. Execution Description, Validation Objective, Command Methodology/Execution Details, Parser Notes, and Known Runtime Constraints now say remote_dram uses the detected NUMA node count (not `num_numa_nodes`, which is metadata only) and is reported as not measured on a single-node host. 209/409 Raw Output Example shows the current CSV (the old 409 `SUMMARY {...}` line and the 209 remote_dram 75.7 ns row, measured on node 0, are gone).
- **Not changed:** the `num_numa_nodes` parameter and `--num-numa-nodes` flag remain (metadata only).

## 2026-10-01 — 108/208/308/408 iperf3: received throughput, real UDP rate

#1 TCP loopback throughput and #2 UDP throughput reported what the sender pushed, and UDP was capped at 1 Mbit/s (about 0.001 Gb/s), so #2 echoed the configured cap rather than a measured rate.

- **`iperf3-amd` and `iperf3-nvidia` `collect_workload.py`:** #1 and #2 (and `bits_per_second`) now come from `end.sum_received.bits_per_second`, the receiver side. For older iperf3 UDP output with no `sum_received`, the sender rate in `end.sum` is scaled by `(packets - lost_packets) / packets`. TCP retransmits still come from `sum_sent`. AMD records an error (blank value) instead of 0 when the JSON has no receiver figure, as NVIDIA already did.
- **UDP rate:** default `-b` is 10G (was 1M); an empty or 0 `bandwidth_limit` uses the default instead of 1M. **AMD 108/308 now reads `bandwidth_limit`**; it previously looked only for `bandwidth`/`udp_bandwidth`, so the workbook parameter was ignored and UDP always ran at 1M.
- **Workbook:** `bandwidth_limit` is 10G for smoke/baseline/extended (Parameters_SmokeBaselineExtend rows 72, 366, 700, 994) and in all twelve run-command cells (F/G/H of rows 108, 208, 308, 408). Execution Description, Command Methodology, Known Runtime Constraints, and 308/408 Output Fields describe the new rate and receiver-side fields.
- **Not changed:** the peer is still loopback 127.0.0.1 (NVIDIA can use `BENCHMARK_IPERF_PEER`; AMD cannot), so #1/#2 measure host CPU/kernel loopback, not the NIC. Metric names and keys are unchanged. A high UDP rate on loopback can raise #3 jitter and #4 packet loss; no limits exist for these metrics.

## 2026-10-01 — 201/401: VBIOS revision match metric removed

`#6: VBIOS revision match when a required revision is configured (vbios_revision_match)` is deleted from NVIDIA System Config Verification (201/401). It had a value only when `vbios_inforom_versions` named a specific VBIOS version; the default is `present`, so it was always blank and `print_metric_summary.py` omitted its line. Output Fields and Success Criteria already described five metrics.

- **`system-config-nvidia/files/scripts/collect_workload.py`:** no `vbios_revision_match` column; the `vbios_inforom_versions` comparison is removed. The detected VBIOS version is written to `<run-dir>/vbios_version.txt` for information only. Metric #3 (`vbios_string_present`) still requires a VBIOS Version string.
- **Workbook rows 201 (38) and 401 (110):** Metrics end at #5; Raw Output Example drops the column. 201 Execution Description says `vbios_inforom_versions` is accepted but not compared.
- **Not changed:** the `vbios_inforom_versions` parameter (Parameter_04) and its `--vbios-inforom-versions` run-command flag remain, so existing commands still work; the value no longer affects any metric.

## 2026-10-01 — 201/401: driver compliance column renamed to the spec key

- **`system-config-nvidia/files/scripts/collect_workload.py`:** CSV column `driver_version_compliance` is now `driver_compliance_percent`, the key in metric #4 "Driver version compliance percent". The summary printed #4 as NOT FOUND because neither the key nor the label matched the old column name. No `gate.json` exists for this component, so no limit was affected.
- **Workbook rows 201 (38) and 401 (110):** Raw Output Example now matches the collector's actual header (adds `vbios_revision_match`, uses `driver_compliance_percent`) and shows `vbios_string_present` as 1.0 (the collector writes 1/0, not 100). 401 Raw Output Format now says one aggregate row duplicated as two samples, as 201 already did.

## 2026-10-01 — 101/301: firmware compliance metric removed

`#3: Firmware compliance percent (firmware_compliance_percent)` is deleted from System Config Verification (101/301). It had a value only when the yaml named an expected firmware version, which nothing supplied, so it was always blank and its 100% gate was skipped without a message.

- **Workbook rows 101 (2) and 301 (74):** Metrics now #1 ROCm package mismatch count, #2 Kernel/driver mismatch count, #3 Driver compliance percent, #4 Permission error count. Raw Output Example and Output Fields / Metrics to Parse drop the column (301's Output Fields now lists the four metric keys instead of stale names). 301 Success Criteria says 4 metrics; Command Methodology no longer lists firmware version.
- **`system-config-amd/files/scripts/collect_workload.py`:** no `firmware_compliance_percent` column; `declared_firmware()` and `firmware_percent()` removed. The detected firmware/VBIOS revision is written to `<run-dir>/firmware_version.txt` for information only (no pass/fail).
- **`system-config-amd/gate.json`:** removed `firmware_compliance_percent_min`/`_max` and the `firmware-compliance` entry in `required_metric_lines`.
- **Not changed:** 201/401 `#6 vbios_revision_match` has the same configured-only design. `driver_compliance_percent` (101/301 #3) is 100 exactly when the amdgpu half of `kernel_driver_mismatch_count` is 0.

## 2026-10-01 — 203/403 use the same three metrics as 103/303

NVIDIA CPU + System Stress (203/403) now reports exactly the AMD metrics: #1 Peak GPU junction temperature (`peak_gpu_junction_temp_c`), #2 Sustained GPU power (`sustained_gpu_power_w`), #3 GPU ECC error count (`gpu_system_ecc_error_count`).

- **`system-stress-nvidia/files/scripts/collect_workload.py`:** writes one CSV row per second with the same columns as `system-stress-amd` (was one aggregate row duplicated as two samples). Temperature is the hottest GPU's `temperature.gpu`, power the highest per-GPU `power.draw`; `parse_results.py` takes the max of `peak_*` and the mean of `sustained_*`. ECC is `ecc.errors.uncorrected.volatile.total` summed over GPUs (was a count of non-zero correctable/uncorrectable lines) and is blank when ECC is `[N/A]`. All GPUs are read (was the last line only). Peak CPU temperature (`peak_cpu_package_temp_c`) and its `/sys/class/thermal` polling are removed; `thermal_throttle_event_count` stays as a non-metric column, counted as entries into `hw_thermal_slowdown`.
- **Workbook rows 203 (40) and 403 (112):** Metrics, Output Fields / Metrics to Parse, Raw Output Format, Raw Output Example, and Validation Objective match the new output; 203 Execution Description, Command Tools, Command Methodology, and Command Execution Details no longer mention host thermal zones or `nvidia-smi -q -d ECC`. Removed the `*` on "Thermal throttle events" and the stale 'Not Active' notes.
- **Not changed:** on NVIDIA, `temperature.gpu` is the GPU core temperature, not a junction/hotspot reading; the shared label "Peak GPU junction temperature" is accurate for AMD only. NVIDIA still has no `gate.json`, so no temperature/power/ECC limits are applied for 203/403. Neither collector applies GPU load (`gpu_load_percent` is unused on NVIDIA), so sustained GPU power is measured under CPU-only stress.

## 2026-10-01 — Remove the nested template copy once a workload passes

Generated repositories no longer keep `ai-agent-gpu-benchmark-repo-generator_copy/` after generation. Its ~830 duplicated files put the deepest paths at 267–303 characters, so copying a finished batch on Windows failed with path-too-long errors.

- **New `scripts/remove_template_copy.py --repo-root <repo>`:** saves each resolved component's `gate.json` to `results/component_gates.json`, deletes the nested `*_copy/` (Windows long-path safe; read-only files handled), and records `template_copy_removed_at` in `results/generation_manifest.json`. `template_copy_path` and `template_copy_sha256` stay as the provenance record. It refuses to run from inside the copy, only deletes top-level `*_copy` folders that contain generator markers, and is safe to re-run. `--dry-run` lists what it would delete.
- **`scripts/create_one_workload.py`:** removes the copy after a workload passes validation. A failed workload keeps its copy for debugging. `--keep-template-copy` opts out. In reuse mode the VM copy step first deletes a stale `*_copy` folder under `/opt/benchmarks/<repo>`, so the VM mirrors the local tree.
- **`self_check_generated_repo.sh` / `smoke_check_generated_repo.sh`:** a present copy must still be complete. A missing copy passes only when the manifest records `template_copy_removed_at`. The component-gate `forbidden_cli` check reads `results/component_gates.json` when the copy is gone, and prints `NOT EVALUATED` instead of skipping silently when neither source exists.
- **`schemas/generation_report.schema.json`:** adds `template_copy_removed_at` (date-time).
- **`prepare_github_publish.sh`:** strips `scripts/remove_template_copy.py` and `results/component_gates.json`.
- **Tests:** `tests/test_remove_template_copy.py`; `scripts/test_nested_template_copy.sh` now checks removal and the manifest record.
- **Docs:** AGENTS.md, AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md (Completion gates, root cleanup), generation-workflow.md, repository-template.md, README.md, AI_AGENT_HANDOFF.md, SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md item 4.9.
- **Not changed:** `create_generated_repo.py` still creates the copy and leaves it in place, because generation steps run from it. The legacy `create_generated_batch.py` (not for agent use) does not remove it; run the new script afterward if you use it.

## 2026-09-29 — Fresh-VM fixes from the /opt/benchmarks loop (Project277–280)

A refreshed VM with all 32 repos installed together exposed setup steps that had only worked because earlier development had already configured the machine. Each fix is the smallest change that removes that dependency.

- **201–232 host Python:** the CPU and NVIDIA setup skeletons and the four NVIDIA vLLM/SGLang overlay `setup.sh` files use `/usr/bin/python3` unless `BENCHMARK_PYTHON` is set. An interactive root `PATH` put the image's uv Python 3.11 first, and Ubuntu 24.04 has no `python3.11-venv`, so strict setups (206–213, 227–230) exited in apt.
- **301–332 ROCm firmware:** `setup_rocm_reboot_skeleton.sh` no longer treats `/opt/rocm/bin/rocm-smi` alone as a ready runtime. When `/lib/firmware/updates/amdgpu` and `/lib/firmware/amdgpu` are both empty it runs `rocm_install_runtime`, which installs `amdgpu-dkms-firmware` and reboots once. The refreshed 26.04 image had ROCm userspace but no GPU firmware, so the MI300X never initialized.
- **401–426 CUDA toolkit:** on Ubuntu 26.04 the NVIDIA skeleton installs `cuda-toolkit-13-3` (same check as the SGLang setups) instead of `cuda-nvcc-13-1`. Repos set up at 13.1 refused to run after 430 installed 13.3 and moved `/usr/local/cuda`. Other Ubuntu versions are unchanged.
- **427–429 ninja:** the three vLLM NVIDIA setups `pip install ninja` into the venv before the FlashInfer warmup, and `flashinfer_warmup.py` puts the venv `bin` first on `PATH`. The setup-time warmup (new in TEMPLATE_92) needed `ninja`, which a fresh VM lacks until another setup installs it.
- **430–431 ZeroMQ path:** `nvcc_flashinfer_workspace` keeps nvcc temp files in the repo cache but exports `TMPDIR` as a short `/tmp/fi-<8 hex>` symlink to it. The repo-cache path exceeded the 107-byte Unix socket limit for SGLang's IPC sockets.
- **407 STREAM timeout:** the per-iteration allowance in both STREAM collectors scales with `array_size / 10M` (+120 s). Extended (40M × 32000) was killed at the old 1660 s limit.
- **124/224/324/424 SDXL load:** with `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`, `infer_sdxl.py` loads the cached fp16 snapshot directory instead of the repo id. Newer `huggingface_hub` rejects the fp16-only prefetch by repo id (`IncompleteSnapshotError`).
- **VM install location:** `scripts/create_one_workload.py` copies, sets up, and validates each repo in `/opt/benchmarks/<Workload Number>-<Repo Name>` (`--remote-root`, default `/opt/benchmarks`) instead of `/root/<...>`. Docs and the ROCm `/etc/motd` hint follow `REPO_ROOT`/`/opt/benchmarks`.
- **Runtime ledger location:** `scripts/update_runtime_ledger.py` writes `/var/opt/benchmarks/runtime_ledger.csv` by default (override with `BENCHMARK_RUNTIME_LEDGER` or `--ledger`) and prints `Runtime entry added to /var/opt/benchmarks/runtime_ledger.csv.` after each row, including failure rows. The seven overlay runners that wrote the ledger before the Metrics block (SDXL AMD/NVIDIA, SGLang NVIDIA ×2, vLLM NVIDIA ×3) now write it after, so that line follows the metrics as in every other repo.
- **Not changed:** the `vllm_rocm_sitecustomize.py` device-count recursion only occurs when the GPU is already down. Originals of every edited file are in `Project281_TEMPLATE_93_20260928/_backup_before_claude_20260929`.

## 2026-09-29 — Convolution bandwidth and cuDNN solver search

- **118/318:** CSV header `GB/s` is aliased to `memory_bandwidth_gb_s`. The substring fallback is removed from `resolve_metrics` (it reported batch size `n`=32). Headline metrics are the forward rows, with per-direction keys `<metric>_<direction>`. MIOpenDriver uses `kernel_width`, stride, groups, dtype (`convfp16` / `convbfp16` / `conv`), and same padding `k/2`.
- **218/418:** the harness honors dtype (FP16 and BF16 use tensor-op math), `conv_direction` (timed fwd, bwd-data, and bwd-weights), and `search_strategy` (timed `cudnnFind`; `solver_search_msec` is that wall time summed across directions, and was the constant 0.05). Fabricated 0.9×/0.8× backward TFLOPS are removed. Same padding `k/2` matches MIOpen. Expected runtime is about 3× per pass because three directions run; `num_iterations` is unchanged. The collector subprocess timeout is the direction count times the per-iteration allowance, plus 120 s for Find. `run_benchmark.sh` has no separate timeout. At the historical ~0.5 ms/iter, baseline 168000 × 2 passes is about 8 minutes and extended 514000 × 2 passes is about 26 minutes, plus three cold Finds per pass.

## 2026-09-28 — Honest metric names and a few measurement fixes

Source: `MetricsUpdates_for_TEMPLATE_00_92_20260928a.xlsx`, column “Cursor Instructions for TEMPLATE_00_92 updates”. Rows that say to leave the item for later (MIOpen bandwidth, cuDNN solver-search time) are unchanged. Rows with an empty instruction cell are unchanged.

- **Workbook `Workload_Definitions` Metrics** now name what the collectors actually record: GPU temperature, IOPS mean, TCP loopback gigabits/s, UDP gigabits/s, local DRAM pointer-chase bandwidth, cache misses per 1,000 instructions, 16 MB stride-128 read latency, 8-byte payload update rate, PyTorch matmul GFLOPS, sum of absolute residuals, minimum operand traffic, relative L1 of the checked columns, mean minimum-traffic estimate, MI300X FP64 matrix peak, FP64 tensor-core peak, modeled ResNet traffic, tanh matmul-stack tokens/s, decode throughput and TPOT at measured KV occupancy, peak KV-cache GB, VBIOS string present, even-word store pass rate, and peak GPU power. STREAM DDR5-efficiency `#5` is removed (107/207/307/407). SGLang completed-request percentage `#4` is removed on 230/430 and RadixAttn becomes `#4`. 304 uses the same even-word name as 104 because they share the AMD collector.
- **System config:** AMD mismatch count is uname `-r` versus `kernel_version` plus the amdgpu `version:` field versus `driver_version`. Firmware compliance is one 0/100 compare against `firmware_version` in the config, or blank when that version is not named. Driver compliance is that same amdgpu version compare, once per run. NVIDIA mismatch count compares the loaded nvidia module, `nvidia-smi`, and the libcuda SONAME. VBIOS presence is 0/1; a required revision in `vbios_inforom_versions` is a separate 0/100.
- **Health and stress:** PCIe width is the current link width and is blank when absent (102/202/302/402). AMD PCIe speed is sysfs `current_link_speed` and is blank when that file is missing (102/302). NVIDIA stress stores the max one-second power sample as `peak_gpu_power_w` (203/403).
- **ECC and correctness:** NVIDIA uncorrected and corrected counts are sums of the integer counters, with volatile and aggregate kept apart. AMD tensor cases are compliant when absolute error is within atol or the true relative error is within rtol (105/305).
- **NCCL:** `busbw_gb_s` is blank when `num_gpus` is less than 2; `algbw_gb_s` is still written (216/416).
- **FIO:** the mean job IOPS is `iops_mean`. Synthetic p95 and p99 copies are left blank.

## 2026-09-28 — Retune baseline and extended durations from the 2026-09-28 ledgers

- **Parameters:** `Parameters_SmokeBaselineExtend` duration knobs were rescaled from `aggregated_runtime_ledgers_101_201_301_401_20260928_9am.xlsx`, aiming at ~4:00 baseline (3–5 min) and ~12:00 extended (8–15 min). Where baseline and extended differ only in the knob, a two-point fit removed server start and load time before scaling. Smoke values are unchanged. Command columns were regenerated with `scripts/sync_matrix_profile_commands.py`.
- **multichase:** 109 and 309 `num_iterations` 1.33e9/3.73e9 → 2.9e9/8.8e9 (measured 1:46–2:00 and 4:46–5:24). 209 and 409 are unchanged.
- **lmbench `repetitions`:** 112 2/5 → 5/14 (1:26–1:33, 3:48–4:17). 312 baseline 3 → 5 (2:11–2:20); extended 9 is unchanged. 412 3/10 → 5/14 (2:14–2:16, 7:15–7:25).
- **KV cache `num_prompts`:** 127 397/1320 → 200/800 (6:14–7:14, 18:58). 327 397/1320 → 208/880 (5:40–6:40, 17:04–17:10). 427 450/1320 → 192/920 (6:39–7:04, 16:13).
- **NCCL `num_iterations`:** 216 1.1e6/1.52e6 → 480000/850000 (7:45–7:51, 19:49–21:02). 416 600000/1.52e6 → 330000/880000 (5:52, 19:08–19:29).
- **Torch micro `num_iterations`:** 219 420000/1230000 → 1140000/2750000 (1:38, 5:29–5:31). 419 → 860000/2000000 (2:04–2:05, 7:31).
- **JAX `num_iterations`:** 226 101450/424800 → 380000/760000 (1:08–1:10, 6:07–6:17). 426 101450/515850 → 380000/780000 (1:09, 7:25).
- **STREAM `num_iterations`:** 207 extended 25000 → 36000 (6:39–9:05). 407 14500/15600 → 24000/32000 (1:51–2:11, 4:44–4:49). Today's 407 rate is about half the 2026-09-24 rate, so 407 is aimed low.
- **ResNet-50 inference:** 422 `num_iterations` 6400/16200 → 4500/4600 (5:33–5:37, 45:11).
- **RAG:** 432 `query_count` 100/250 → 220/680 (1:57–2:09, 4:35).
- **Left unchanged:** 227, 228, and 229 are overlay-locked. `vllm-kvcache-nvidia`, `vllm-throughput-nvidia`, and `vllm-token-generation-nvidia` ship `config/benchmark_config.yaml`, and `generate_benchmark_config.py` does not write over it. The measured runtimes follow that yaml (227: 96/224 prompts at output_len 128; 228/229: output_len 16000/24000), not this sheet. Workbook edits do not reach those repos. 205 and 405 (overlay-locked), 105/305 correctness, and x01/x02 config/health checks are short by design.

## 2026-09-27 — Retune baseline and extended durations from the 2026-09-27 ledgers

- **Parameters:** `Parameters_SmokeBaselineExtend` duration knobs were scaled from `AggregatedRuntimeLedgers_20260927` so a linear repeat lands near 4:00 baseline (inside 3–5 min) and near 12:00 extended (inside 8–15 min). Smoke values are unchanged. Command columns were regenerated from that sheet.
- **NUMA pointer hops:** 110 `num_iterations` 6.3e9/1.85e10 → 2.5e9/7.4e9 (measured 9:56–10:00 and 29:57). 210 and 410 → 7.8e8/2.3e9 (measured ~27 min and 96 min / 78 min). 310 → 1.8e9/4.0e9 so the 10:46 and 17:09 baselines both fall inside 3–5 min, and the 55:59 extended falls near 12:00.
- **GUPS:** 113 and 313 `num_iterations` → 1600/1900. Measured baselines were 0:25–0:31 and extended 0:34–0:43. Table size and update count stay the same.
- **SGLang output length:** 131 → 840/1700 (baselines 6:36 and 9:17, extended 34:31). 331 → 890/1900 (15:11 and 33:09). 231 and 431 → 3250/7000 (baselines 9:50 and 9:20; 231 extended 23:27). Prompt counts stay 24/48.
- **Left unchanged:** 312 lmbench. The same `repetitions=3` baseline was 11:15 and 2:15, and extended was 12:44, so the long run is not a repetition-count problem. 112, 212, 213, 412, and 413 were already inside the windows.

## 2026-09-27 — FIO metric #1 label for 206/406 is IOPS p50

- **Workbook:** workloads 206 and 406 Metrics `#1` is now `IOPS p50 (iops_p50)`. The previous label said `IOPS aggregate, duplicated p50/95/99`. The collector column is unchanged.

## 2026-09-27 — SGLang serving metrics for 231/431 match 131

- **Workbook:** workloads 231 and 431 `Metrics` and `Output Fields / Metrics to Parse` now use the same p50 keys as 131 (`end_to_end_request_latency_p50_msec`, `ttft_p50_msec`, `time_per_output_token_tpot_p50_msec`, `inter_token_latency_itl_p50_msec`, `request_throughput_requests_sec`). The serving collector writes those columns. The old p99 names were calculated and then left out of the results file, so `#1` and `#2` (and 431's `#3` and `#4`) were skipped. Raw-output examples for 231 and 431 cite the p50 columns.

## 2026-09-27 — CUDA 13 convolution libraries, version-gated tensor_ir, component probes

- **cuDNN pin:** convolution components on CUDA 13 install `nvidia-cudnn-cu13==9.23.2.1` into that repo's virtualenv. `torch==2.13.0+cu130` pulls `nvidia-cudnn-cu13==9.20.0.48`, which does not ship `libcudnn_engines_tensor_ir.so.9`. Ubuntu 24.04 stays on `torch==2.7.1+cu128` and does not receive the CUDA 13 package. vLLM, SGLang, DistilBERT, BERT, and RAG are unchanged.
- **Host libraries:** a system `tensor_ir` is moved to `/opt/cudnn-host-extra` only when its version differs from the virtualenv `nvidia-cudnn` package. Setup wraps only the current repo's `bin/cudnn_conv`, and skips the wrap when the virtualenv already ships `tensor_ir`. `collect_cudnn_conv.py` prepends `/opt/cudnn-host-extra` only when the library file is there. `align_nvidia_userspace()` is unchanged.
- **Build:** `cudnn-convolution-nvidia` keeps a CUDA 12 nvcc when `cuda-12.8` or `cuda-12.6` exists, and links the venv cu13 cuDNN with rpath only when the nvcc it invokes is CUDA 13 (superseded 2026-10-02: the wheel is found by `libcudnn.so.9` and `cudnn.h`, see that entry). The glibc `__THROW` override is passed only to `ecc_walk.cu` and `cudnn_conv.cu`, and only when that nvcc is CUDA 13 and glibc is 2.41 or newer. memcpy, NCCL, and HPL build scripts are unchanged.
- **Setup gate:** the NVIDIA skeleton runs `scripts/probe_setup.sh` when the component overlaid it. PyTorch convolution components run one fp16 `conv2d`. The cuDNN component runs `bin/cudnn_conv`. The probe fails setup; it does not repair the library.
- **JAX:** `jax[cuda13]` when `torch.version.cuda` major is 13, otherwise `jax[cuda12]`. A missing extra fails the install. The post-install check is a JIT matmul and runs only when JAX was requested.

## 2026-09-27 — cuDNN tensor_ir remains loadable by every convolution harness

- **Host libraries:** a pip cuDNN wheel that lacks `libcudnn_engines_tensor_ir` still causes that newer system sublibrary to be moved to `/opt/cudnn-host-extra`. The move is host-global, so setup wraps every existing `bin/cudnn_conv` (the repo being installed, sibling repos, and `/root/*/bin/cudnn_conv`). A later PyTorch, vLLM, or SGLang setup no longer leaves an earlier `cudnn_conv` binary unable to load `tensor_ir`. Superseded the same day by the version-gated move above.

## 2026-09-25 — TEMPLATE_00_88 NVIDIA harness and host-library contracts

- **Collector gate:** `scripts/collect_workload.py` is the harness entry. Create writes an adapter when the overlay ships `collect_*.py` under another name, and fails if the runner still calls `collect_workload.py` and neither the overlay nor the adapter provided it. `entry_point` is no longer inferred as the first overlay path. NVIDIA STREAM uses `stream-collect-nvidia` (same role as `stream-collect-amd`).
- **Framework flags:** `framework_registry.py` loads its YAML without PyYAML when the system interpreter has none. The NVIDIA skeleton evaluates the registry with `.venv/bin/python` after PyYAML is installed. NVIDIA flags install `fio`, `iperf3`, and, for NCCL workloads, `libnccl-dev` from the distro CUDA repository.
- **Host libraries:** if `nvidia-smi` fails and `libcuda` / `libnvidia-ml` for the loaded kernel module exist, setup pins those sonames and moves only the mismatched copies aside. A working `nvidia-smi` is left unchanged, so a matched Ubuntu 24.04 image is not rewritten. A pip cuDNN wheel that lacks `libcudnn_engines_tensor_ir` causes that newer system sublibrary to be moved to `/opt/cudnn-host-extra`; `bin/cudnn_conv` is wrapped to load it. `/dev/nvidiactl` does not replace a working `nvidia-smi`.
- **Container NUMA:** multichase and the NUMA-cache collector retry unbound when `numactl` reports that the NUMA policy is not permitted or not supported.
- **Blank metrics:** vLLM KV and SGLang prompt-response averages skip blank cells. Validator `cache_hit` columns may be zero. Serving clients blank inter-token latency when it copies time-per-output-token. The end-of-run summary prints p50, p95, and p99 as separate values.
- **Remote retry:** `--validate-only --reuse-remote-env` keeps `.venv` only when `.env_reuse_stamp` matches the framework flags and CUDA wheel index, and `results/install_status.txt` does not show a failed framework-registry import. A mismatch removes `.venv` and `.setup_state`.
- **Docs:** `fill_generated_docs.py` remains the only writer for PRD, SPEC, and README. Leftover `{{Field}}` tokens still fail the run, and the README kernel version still comes from the yaml.

## 2026-09-25 — TEMPLATE_00_87 official create contracts and metrics D1–D4

Source: authorized Cursor-101 generator work for Project245 / TEMPLATE_00_87. D5 (streaming TTFT) is out of scope.

- **Dash directory naming:** local folder and GitHub slug are `<Workload Number>-<Repo Name>` (example `101-sys-bench-amd-rocm-stack-validation-ubu2404`). Workbook `Repo Name` stays unprefixed. Legacy `_` folders are still found.
- **Windows-to-VM driver:** `scripts/create_one_workload.py` uses Git Bash + OpenSSH (`scripts/host_exec.py`), not WSL `bash -lc`. After a setup reboot it waits for SSH and resumes. `--validate-only --reuse-remote-env` retries without wiping `.venv`/`.cache`.
- **Create gates:** missing `scripts/collect_workload.py` (or component `entry_point`) fails create. Locked overlay `config/benchmark_config.yaml` is merged, not replaced. Official docs come from `scripts/fill_generated_docs.py`. Text writes are LF. `tests/fixtures/.gitkeep` and results gitkeeps are restored after copy.
- **Contracts:** `config/framework_registry.yaml` + `scripts/framework_registry.py` own Framework install flags. `config/platform_policy.yaml` owns OS/vendor/driver (one ROCm reboot). Shared blank/0/positive rules live in `scripts/metric_contract.py`. Fixture tests: `tests/test_template_87_contracts.py`.
- **Metrics D1–D4:** `print_metric_summary.py` prints the first parenthetical key and unmashes `p50_p95_p99` to p50. SGLang/vLLM serving collectors emit real p50/p95/p99. SGLang ITL is blank (not copied from TPOT).

## 2026-09-24 — remaining metrics_summary alignments (115/205/224/203)

Source: leftover cross-vendor closer gaps after the NOT FOUND / `not measured` pass. Checked against current collectors and live `nvidia-smi` on Ubuntu 24.04 and 26.04 NVIDIA hosts (both Driver 580, `Not Active` / `Active`).

- **115/315 BabelStream Metrics:** cite the five per-kernel keys the AMD parser already writes (`bandwidth_gb_s_copy` … `bandwidth_gb_s_dot`), matching 215/415's five-kernel set. Blind mean / peak% stay in `summary.json` but are no longer numbered Metrics.
- **224/424 SDXL Metrics:** add `#4` `step_time_ms` and `#5` `first_image_latency_s`. `infer_sdxl.py` now prints those keys on the RESULT line; `collect_sdxl.py` copies them into METRICS_CSV. NVIDIA `parse_results.py` no longer estimates step time from per-image latency, and no longer substitutes first-image with mean image time.
- **205/405 tensor correctness:** `tolerance_compliance` is now percent of cases (same meaning as 105/305), not a 1/0 flag. Workbook Metrics order matches AMD: max abs, max rel, % in tolerance, coverage, failures. Gate `tolerance_compliance_min` is 100. Overlay now ships `scripts/collect_workload.py` (forwards to `collect_tensor_ops.py`) so `run_benchmark.sh` finds the harness entry; `--raw-file` / `--profile` are accepted and ignored.
- **NVIDIA 26.04 setup:** `setup_nvidia_skeleton.sh` accepts Debian `libcudart` (`/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`), tries `cuda-nvcc-13-1` / `nvidia-cuda-toolkit` when 12.6/12.8 packages are absent, and continues when `nvidia-smi` has a driver/library mismatch if `/dev/nvidiactl` is present (RunPod host-injected driver). BabelStream `build.sh` treats a failed `nvidia-smi` as non-fatal (`|| true` under `pipefail`) and infers `sm_90`/`sm_80` from `/proc/driver/nvidia/gpus`. NVIDIA BabelStream and tensor overlays now ship `scripts/collect_workload.py` wrappers so `run_benchmark.sh` finds the harness entry.
- **203/403 throttle:** `nvidia-smi` field `clocks_throttle_reasons.hw_thermal_slowdown` is `Active` or `Not Active`. The old substring `Active` matched `Not Active` every poll. The collector now requires an exact `Active` token and counts 0→1 transitions. Confirmed the same wording on both NVIDIA 24.04 and 26.04 hosts. Validator `zero_ok` now matches `throttl` so `thermal_throttling_events=0` is accepted (`throttle` is not a substring of `throttling`). When NVML is unusable (`Failed to initialize NVML` / driver mismatch), GPU temp and power are left blank instead of parsing the library version (e.g. `580.178`) as a temperature.

## 2026-09-24 — metrics_summary.txt: correct values, honest placeholders, consistent headers

Source: review of the newest `metrics_summary.txt` for all 128 workloads (Projects 236–239). Pre-change copies: `archive/20260924_before_gary_ledger_retune/metrics_summary_fixes/`. Checked by replaying the old and new parser/printer on those 128 runs' raw output; hardware collectors were compile/unit-tested only.

**Summary values (generated `parse_results.py`, `print_metric_summary.py`)**
- Raw output with more than one CSV table is no longer merged under the first header. The table whose columns best match the workload's Metrics is used. This fixes scrambled vLLM summaries (e.g. 128 TPOT 62.6 ms → 8.3 ms, E2E 68.5 s → 137 s; 129 TPOT 515.6 ms → 7.8 ms; 127 TTFT 607 ms → 27 ms).
- Aggregation follows the column's leading word: `peak_`/`max_` → max, `min_` → min, `first_` → first row, otherwise mean (was always mean; e.g. 103 "peak" temperature 39.0 → 45).
- A metric column that is blank on every row is reported as `not measured` (was dropped and printed as NOT FOUND, or turned into 0.0 by the SGLang parsers).
- Printed values are rounded (whole numbers without `.0`; ≥1 to 3 decimals; <1 to 4 significant digits). summary.json keeps full precision.

**Collectors**
- 202/402 `gpu-health-nvidia`: PCIe width/speed read from the `--query-gpu` CSV (width was the temperature, speed 0); speed reported in GT/s like AMD.
- 112/212/312/412 lmbench: each tool's result parsed from its own position (bw_mem was the 8.39 MB buffer size, lat_ctx the process count 2, AMD lat_mem_rd the array size); 212/412 syscall latency converted to ns to match its column name.
- 216/416 NCCL: sweeps min_bytes..max_bytes (was 8-byte messages only, ~0.001 GB/s); bus/alg bandwidth reported at the largest message, latency at the smallest; per-size data in `nccl_sweep.csv`; rounds halved (baseline 10 / extended 24) to hold duration — re-time on next run.
- 103/303 `system-stress-amd`: CPU temperature read from hwmon/thermal zone (was a copy of the GPU temperature); ECC from `amd-smi` when reported; throttle, CPU utilisation and unreadable sensors left blank instead of fixed 0/1.0.
- Fixed/estimated values replaced by blank ("not measured") or a real computation: 104/304 ECC; 117/317 CPU-Gflops and L1 norm; 118/318 GB/s (now computed from tensor sizes); 121/321 TFLOPS (model-FLOPs formula, same as NVIDIA twin) and memory bandwidth; 122/322 GPU utilisation; 126/326 TFLOPS (exact matmul FLOPs), compile time and peak HBM (from JAX); 130/230/330/430 TTFT fallback and RadixAttention hit rate; 131/231/331/431 TTFT (was 0.4 × E2E); 127/327 and 227/427 KV-cache figures (were formulas); 113/313 TLB/L3; 110–410 cache misses without perf, and remote latency/ratio on single-NUMA-node hosts; 111/311 perf floors (0.001 / 1.0).
- 105/305 relative error uses max(|ref|, atol) as denominator (was 1e-6, giving ~517 with 100% compliance).

**Header**
- Run ID = run folder name (was the SQLite row id: 1, blank or leftover 12–17).
- Device = `cpu` for CPU / System workloads (was always `gpu`); collectors still receive `--device` unchanged.
- Elapsed = printed Stop − Start (was 3–8 s longer: taken after the hardware/software inventory). The ledger `total_runtime` uses the same value.
- SDXL/SGLang/vLLM overlay run folders now use the repo folder name (they omitted `<N>_` and the `-ubu2404`/`-ubu2604` suffix) and no longer print a hard-coded Run ID such as `124_…` in 324.

**Workbook (`Workload_Definitions` › Metrics)**
- Labels no longer describe removed placeholders ("always 0", "fixed 1.0", "= TTFT", "est. 0.4x E2E"); blank labels filled (201/401 #2, 227/427 #4); units added (lmbench, PCIe, NCCL).
- 114/314 now report H2D, D2H and D2D bandwidth at the largest transfer plus latency, like 214/414 (was one blended "combined" figure, 369 GB/s).
- 107/307 metric order aligned with 207/407 (Copy, Scale, Add, Triad, efficiency).
- 225/425 "Status code, fixed 1.0" removed (4 metrics, like 125/325).
- Ledger note: metric positions change for 107/307, 114/314 and 225/425.

**Not changed:** Artifacts/SQLite paths remain the server paths; "Command submitted" vs "fully resolved" kept as-is (intentional); cross-vendor metric-set differences that need new measurements (111 vs 211, 115 vs 215, 124 vs 224) remain.

## 2026-09-24 — Retime Gary-question workloads; fix NVIDIA GUPS/BabelStream collectors

Source: `runtime_ledger_101_132_20260924_071518_Excel_ALL_FOUR.xlsx` (sheet `runtime_ledge_ALL_FOUR_Edit3`). Targets: baseline ~4:00 (3–5 min), extended ~11:30 (8–15 min). Each changed row's `notes` cell records the measured times, rate and arithmetic. All values are unconfirmed until the next loop run.

- `Parameters_SmokeBaselineExtend` (baseline/extended): 112 repetitions 4/13→2/5; 312 repetitions 5/7→3/9; 412 repetitions 5/13→3/10; 213 num_iterations 3160/1600→880/1240; 413 200/125→800/980; 220 13/34→3/10; 420 20/74→3/10; 310 5e4/1e5→6.3e9/1.85e10 (copied from 110); 410 1.5e9/3e9→5.3e9/1.5e10; 407 23280/37560→14500/15600; 424 num_images 32/7→72/130. `Workload_Definitions` command columns regenerated with `scripts/sync_matrix_profile_commands.py` (22 cells).
- `gups-nvidia`: iteration safety cap raised from 200 baseline / 500 extended to 5000 / 10000. The old cap silently truncated the workbook values, which is why earlier 213/413 retunes had no effect.
- `linpack-hpl-nvidia` (220/420, no code change): timed repeats are `min(num_iterations, 6)` baseline and `min(num_iterations, 16)` extended, and `problem_size_N` 65536 is clamped to 32768. Each repeat costs ~70 s of CPU matrix setup and residual work. The new values sit inside those caps.
- `babelstream-hbm-nvidia` (415 ran 5–7 s and reported ~42,000,000 GB/s): `build.sh` now compiles native SASS for the detected `compute_cap`. `babelstream.cu` checks `cudaGetLastError()` after every launch loop and exits 2 when bandwidth is implausible (>20 TB/s). 415 parameter values unchanged; re-measure before retuning.
- Not changed (recommendation only): 203 `system-stress-nvidia` throttle parser counts `Not Active` as a throttle event.
- `linpack-hpl-nvidia` percent-of-peak (220/420 reported 165–185%): `nvhpl.cu` computed peak as SMs × 64 × clock, which ignores FMA (2 flops) and Hopper's FP64 tensor cores used by cuSOLVER `DGETRF` (H100 NVL 15.1 TF instead of 60 TF). Peak is now SMs × FP64 flops/clock/SM × clock from `cudaDevAttrClockRate` with a per-arch table (sm_90 256 tensor / 128 vector; sm_80 128 / 64), and the vector peak is printed alongside. Unknown archs print 0; `collect_workload.py` then leaves percent-of-peak blank (NULL) instead of 0, which validation would reject. `BENCHMARK_PEAK_FP64_TFLOPS` overrides the peak. Expected on H100 NVL: ~41% (220) / ~47% (420).
- Removed metrics that always printed `NOT FOUND` in `metrics_summary.txt` (`Workload_Definitions` › `Metrics`; remaining metrics renumbered): 106/206/306/406 "Queue-depth scaling: not emitted" (4→3); 117/317 "L2/bandwidth: not emitted" (5→4); 213/413 "TLB miss rate" and "L3 cache miss rate", perf counters unavailable on the NVIDIA hosts (5→3; also dropped from `Output Fields / Metrics to Parse`). The ledger pads missing metric slots with blanks. For 213/413, ledger `metric_2`/`metric_3` now hold update rate and memory-controller throughput (previously `metric_4`/`metric_5`).
- Pre-change copies: `archive/20260924_before_gary_ledger_retune/`.

## 2026-09-24 — ROCm first-time setup reboots once (24.04 and 26.04)

- `rocm_install_runtime` in `scripts/lib/rocm_install_24_04.sh` and `scripts/lib/rocm_install_26_04.sh` no longer reboots after `apt upgrade`. It installs the stack in the same invocation and reboots once after the driver/firmware step.
- On 24.04, `linux-modules-extra` is installed for the running kernel and any newer pending kernel so extras exist after that single reboot.
- `setup.sh` operator notice, `docs/rocm-reboot-install-contract.md`, `templates/README_TEMPLATE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` now say one reboot. systemd auto-resume is unchanged.

## 2026-09-22 — Numbered GitHub slugs and finish publish-doc rename

- Publish GitHub repos as `<Workload Number>_<Repo Name>` (same as the local folder). Finished the `GITHUB_PUBLISH.md` / `GITHUB_WORKLOAD_PUBLISH.md` rename, including the per-workload installed copy.

## 2026-09-22 — Template holes found on the 00_84 GitHub/VM pass

- LF-write `config/pyproject.toml` and include `*.toml` in publish/remote CRLF cleanup.
- Default `SKIP_RVS` from Framework (RVS listed → 0) unless `BENCHMARK_SKIP_RVS` is set.
- Inject `numpy>=1.26` for GUPS overlays; check hipcc `hipError_t` in `hip_memcpy_bw.cpp`.
- Keep Metrics parenthetical closers during extract; drop nested-copy sitecustomize fallback; prune `scripts/dir.txt` at publish.

## 2026-09-12 — Remove workbook Implementation Pack column (TEMPLATE_00_84)

- Deleted the `Workload_Definitions` Implementation Pack column from `BenchmarkSpecDefinitions.xlsx`. Generated `benchmark_specification.json` no longer includes that field.
- Component overlays are selected only from `config/implementation_packs.yaml` using Workload Number and GPU Vendor. `scripts/implementation_pack.py` no longer reads a spec field.
- Extract and validate no longer require Implementation Pack. Extract skips the field if an old workbook still has it.
- Removed `scripts/populate_implementation_pack_column.py`, which existed only to write that column.

## 2026-09-11 — 108/208 iperf3 baseline/extended no longer SIGKILL at seconds+30

- `iperf3-amd` and `iperf3-nvidia` collectors timed out `iperf3 -t N -J` at `N+30`. Baseline TCP (`-t 100`) on localhost exceeded 130s (JSON wrap-up), Python SIGKILLed the client (exit 137), and `run_benchmark.sh --profile baseline` died. Extended (`-t 290`) would fail the same way.
- Client timeout is now `max(N+180, N*3)`. Collectors pass `-i 0` so `-J` is a summary, not ~N interval objects. `TimeoutExpired` and invalid JSON are caught and the one-shot server is stopped.

## 2026-09-11 — Remove parameter_overrides.yaml

- Deleted `config/parameter_overrides.yaml`. Smoke/baseline/extended numbers now come only from `BenchmarkSpecDefinitions.xlsx` `Parameters_SmokeBaselineExtend`. Override values were not copied into the workbook.
- `scripts/matrix_profile_values.py`, `scripts/extract_benchmark_definition.py`, and `scripts/generate_benchmark_config.py` no longer load or apply a sidecar override file.
- Live agent instructions (`docs/AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `AGENTS.md` §20.2) no longer tell generators to apply that file.

## 2026-09-10 — Remote validation copies must be 0755, not 0777

- Windows `tar` extract onto the Ubuntu validation VM left `/root/<N>_<Repo Name>/` as `drwxrwxrwx` (lime-green / other-writable in `ls`). After extract, `create_one_workload.py` now runs `find … -type d -exec chmod 755 {} +` and sets regular files to `0644` before restoring `+x` on `.sh` helpers. Agent instructions, generation workflow, AGENTS.md § 29.1, and SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST 3.11e1 require the same `chmod` on any manual copy.

## 2026-09-10 — Setup bundle from Domain+Vendor; Implementation Pack; create_one_workload.py

- **300_1 / setup.sh**: `init_generated_repo.py` no longer greps Framework/Domain for `rocm`/`vllm`/`amd-smi`. It keys `Execution Domain` first (`CPU / System` → `cpu-system` skeleton) then `GPU Vendor` (`AMD` → ROCm skeleton, `NVIDIA` → NVIDIA skeleton). Empty `touch()` of `setup.sh` is a hard fail. New `scripts/templates/setup_cpu_system_skeleton.sh` covers 106–113-class host workloads.
- **200_2 / overlays**: `Workload_Definitions` has an `Implementation Pack` column (populated for 128 rows from `config/implementation_packs.yaml`). `resolve_implementation_components.py` copies those component ids; it does not match `Workload Name`. `linpack-rochpl-amd` now overlays `HPL.dat`. `entry_point` is inferred or declared on the component.
- **200_3 / driver**: `scripts/create_one_workload.py` is the chatbox path: create → optional remote setup/smoke/self_check/publish-ready → record. Per-workload errors are `RuntimeError`, not `SystemExit`, so a 124-class miss cannot skip the rest of the batch. Do not call `create_generated_batch.py` from chat.

## 2026-09-10 — 211/411 host-counter fallback when PMU cycles are denied

- **211/411 linux-perf-pmu-nvidia**: the workbook Metrics column is now
  elapsed TSC/PMU `cycles`, child CPU time, CPU utilization, stress-ng
  bogo-ops/s, and context-switch rate. The overlay collector still
  required `perf stat` `cycles`/`instructions` and hard-failed on
  `perf_event_paranoid=4` containers. It now prefers PMU cycles when
  `perf_event_open` works, otherwise persists TSC/rusage/bogo-ops host
  counters and leaves IPC-family columns empty. Still does not invent IPC.

## 2026-09-10 — Root-cause fixes for the 101-132/201-232 TEMPLATE_00_80 batch failures (104/105, 205, 209, 212, 213, 218, 221, 227-229, 230/231, 232)

Traced every failure from the 00_80 101-132 and 201-232 generation batches back
to the generator/template code (not the VM) and fixed the ones that were
fixable without touching a locked overlay file's runtime contract. Each item
below is a repo change, not a one-off repair of an already-generated repo.

- **205/221/226 `--device` vs `--device-id`**: `materialize_generated_harness.py`'s
  generated `run_benchmark.sh` decided whether to forward `--device` with a
  bare `grep -q -- '--device'`, which also matches `--device-id` (a prefix).
  That passed the literal word "gpu"/"cpu" onto collectors that only define
  `--device-id`; argparse prefix-matched it and `int("gpu")` crashed before
  any RESULT/CSV line. Now requires a standalone `--device` flag and falls
  back to `--device-id "${DEVICE_ID:-0}"` when only that flag exists.
- **227-229 JSON raw_output.txt**: the generic `parse_results.py` template
  (`write_parser()`) only ever understood CSV and raised
  `[FAIL] No supported raw output rows were parsed.` on the vLLM components'
  JSON summaries. Added a `load_rows()` fallback: CSV (unchanged) -> sibling
  `raw_results.csv` -> JSON object/array. Existing CSV-emitting components are
  unaffected.
- **213 GUPS validator**: the generic `validate_results.py` template failed
  any sample with a non-empty `error_message` regardless of `status`, so
  GUPS's honest `status=ok, error_message="perf TLB/L3 not measured"`
  (an optional measurement it correctly declined to invent) failed the run.
  Now only a non-"ok" `status` fails a sample.
- **205 `_ensure_thresholds`**: `apply_component_gaps.py` unconditionally
  appended a `thresholds:` block to `config/benchmark_config.yaml`, including
  when that exact path was a component's own locked overlay file -- which is
  what made self_check report "locked overlay rewritten" for 205. Also fixed
  the "already has thresholds" check, which was a bare `"thresholds:" in
  text` substring match that a YAML *comment* containing that word would
  satisfy, silently skipping real injection (the original 101-132 bug).
  Both are now lock-aware / key-aware.
- **104/105 ROCm torch cache**: `setup_rocm_reboot_skeleton.sh` defaulted
  `PIP_CACHE_DIR` to `<repo>/.cache/pip` -- per-repo, not shared -- so 104 and
  105 each cold-downloaded the same ~6.2 GB `torch==2.11.0+rocm7.2` wheel and
  both hit the 60-minute setup/smoke gate before smoke ran. Default is now a
  shared `<parent-of-repo-root>/.shared_pip_cache`, and `install_rocm_pytorch()`
  honors `PYTORCH_FIND_LINKS` when set.
- **218 cuDNN SIGABRT**: `setup_nvidia_skeleton.sh` apt-installed both
  `libcudnn9-cuda-12` and `libcudnn9-cuda-13` whenever `src/cudnn_conv.cu` was
  present (added in the 2026-09-07 00_78 pass, ported from 00_77). `build.sh`
  only ever puts `/usr/local/cuda(-12.8|-12.6)` on PATH -- never cuda-13 -- so
  nvcc there always resolves to a CUDA 12 toolkit; the two ABI-incompatible
  cuDNN builds on the linker path made `bin/cudnn_conv` abort at runtime.
  Now installs only the cuda-12 variant.
- **230/231 torchaudio pin**: `install_sglang_nvidia.sh` (in both
  `sglang-serving-nvidia` and `sglang-prompt-response-nvidia`) pinned
  `torchaudio==2.13.0+cu130`, which has never been published on the cu130
  wheel index (tops out at 2.11.0+cu130) -- added in the same 2026-09-07
  00_78 pass as a version-drift fix, never checked against the live index.
  `setup.sh` died before smoke ran for both workloads every time. Re-pinned
  to `torchaudio==2.11.0+cu130`; torch/torchvision unchanged.
- **212 stale authoring notes**: `extract_benchmark_definition.py` had no
  handling for `TEMPLATE_00_<n>` authoring notes left in workbook cells, so
  they flowed straight into `benchmark_specification.json`/README/SPEC/PRD
  and tripped self_check's `"TEMPLATE_00_" in text` scan. Added
  `_strip_template_notes()` (sentence-level, with a bare-tag fallback so the
  forbidden substring is always gone) inside `_clean_value()`; real
  parameter values are untouched.
- **232 missing collector**: `rag-faiss-end2end-nvidia`/`-amd` were marked
  `completeness: thin` with no `scripts/collect_workload.py` in their
  overlay, so a generated 232/432/132/332 repo had no entry point for
  `run_benchmark.sh` to call. Added a real `scripts/collect_workload.py` to
  both components (resolves `config/benchmark_config.yaml`'s `sweep:` section
  for the active profile and forwards it to `gpu-bench-rag-faiss-end2end.py`)
  and flipped both to `completeness: closed`.
- **209 multichase numactl**: `collect_multichase.py` always bound with
  `numactl --cpunodebind=0 --membind=<N>` and failed the whole collect if
  that `numactl` call itself failed (missing binary, or a requested NUMA
  node that doesn't exist on a single-socket host) -- a host/binding
  problem, not a real zero/failed latency sample. Added `numactl --hardware`
  detection: clamps a requested node to one that actually exists, and drops
  the `numactl` prefix entirely when the binary isn't installed. The "every
  tier must report a positive latency" requirement is unchanged -- a
  genuinely failed chase still fails the run. Also promoted the previously
  ad-hoc, per-generation `scripts/collect_workload.py` wrapper (it existed
  in generated repos but not in this component's overlay) to a real overlay
  file, so future generations get it automatically instead of an agent
  re-authoring it each time.
- **211 perf PMU**: confirmed this is a host permission gap
  (`perf_event_paranoid`/missing `CAP_PERFMON`), not a repo bug -- the
  collector is already doing the right thing by refusing to invent an IPC
  number. No code change.

## 2026-09-09 — 130/131/330/331 real-SGLang duration retune and gluon TensorDescriptor fallback

Ported from the TEMPLATE_00_79 MI300X Ubuntu 24.04 130/131 baseline that
actually started `python -m sglang.launch_server` (not tiny_sglang).

- **Triton gluon gfx1250**: the 2026-09-08 wrap of `gluon/amd/__init__.py`
  was not enough. JIT imports `triton.experimental.gluon.amd.gfx1250`
  directly; an empty except left that package as a stub and crashed the
  scheduler with `AttributeError: ... no attribute TensorDescriptor`.
  `scripts/patch_triton_gluon_gfx1250_optional.py` in
  `sglang-prompt-response-amd` and `sglang-serving-amd` now loads sibling
  `gfx1250.py` by path and exports `TensorDescriptor`. Shared by
  130/330 and 131/331.
- **output_len** (num_prompts unchanged: 8 / 24 / 48): 130 and 330
  baseline **1560** / extended **6100**; 131 and 331 baseline **3370** /
  extended **5480**. 130/131 measured on Ubuntu 24.04 MI300X at 4:13 and
  3:51 (operator later 4:22 / 3:50). 330/331 are the Ubuntu 26.04 AMD
  twins and inherit the same knobs; retune on that host if wall time
  leaves 3-5 / 12-15 min. Written to `Parameters_SmokeBaselineExtend`,
  command columns, and `config/parameter_overrides.yaml`.
- **Setup extras**: `soundfile` and `python-multipart` on the SGLang
  launch pip lines in `setup_rocm_reboot_skeleton.sh`, and the same pins
  in `apply_component_gaps.py` for AMD SGLang `requirements.txt`.

## 2026-09-08 — Ported today's TEMPLATE_00_78 fixes (SGLang gluon patch, duration retunes) ahead of the next AMD/NVIDIA deploy

Gary is deploying the next AMD/NVIDIA VM batch from this template
(`Project215_TEMPLATE_00_79_20260908`), so today's fixes made against the
separate TEMPLATE_00_78 lineage (`Project211_101_to_132_TEMPLATE_78_20260906`
/ `Project212_201_to_232_TEMPLATE_78_20260906`) needed porting over here
first. This template forked from that lineage before today's work (its
`config/parameter_overrides.yaml` and `BenchmarkSpecDefinitions_ORIGINAL.xlsx`
are byte-identical to that pre-fix snapshot) and has since evolved
independently — most visibly the ongoing metrics rewrite and 26-tag
metric-deletion pass — so nothing was copied wholesale; each change was
checked against this template's current state first.

- **130/330, 131/331 SGLang Triton gluon gfx1250 crash fix**: confirmed
  `sglang-prompt-response-amd/files/run_benchmark.sh` and
  `sglang-serving-amd/files/run_benchmark.sh` (and both `component.json`)
  were byte-identical here to their TEMPLATE_00_78 pre-fix versions, so the
  fix ports cleanly. Added `scripts/patch_triton_gluon_gfx1250_optional.py`
  to both components, wired into `run_benchmark.sh` immediately after the
  existing `patch_aiter_gfx1250_optional.py` call, and added to both
  `component.json` `overlay`/`provides` arrays. See the TEMPLATE_00_78
  changelog entry for the full root-cause writeup (Triton's gluon package
  eagerly importing an unrelated gfx1250 backend that references a missing
  symbol on this ROCm/Triton wheel).
- **Duration retunes for 110, 128, 210, 223, 227, 232**: same 2026-09-08
  remote-VM measurements as the TEMPLATE_00_78 pass. Checked each of these
  6 workloads' current `baseline`/`extended` values here first — all 6
  still matched the pre-fix TEMPLATE_00_78 baseline exactly (no independent
  changes on this lineage), so the same values were safe to fold straight
  into both `config/parameter_overrides.yaml` and
  `BenchmarkSpecDefinitions.xlsx` (`Parameters_SmokeBaselineExtend` cell +
  notes, plus the matching `Workload_Definitions` command-column text so
  the spreadsheet doesn't contradict itself).
- **212/412 (lmbench repetitions): found and fixed a live bug, did NOT
  apply my 212 measurement as-is.** This template's own history already
  retuned 212 on 2026-09-07 ("Aligned to match 112/312", baseline=5,
  extended=13), separately from and superseding the original H100
  duration-based retune. But `config/parameter_overrides.yaml` here was
  never updated to match — it still said baseline=300/extended=750 (the
  pre-alignment value) for both 212 and its 412 sibling. Since overrides
  apply after the spreadsheet is read, **that stale entry was silently
  overriding the correct 5/13 at generation time**, meaning a generated
  212/412 repo would actually run the old ~4-hour lmbench loop instead of
  the intended ~4 min / ~12 min runs. Fixed conservatively: corrected the
  override to 5/13 for both, matching what `Parameters_SmokeBaselineExtend`
  already says, rather than asserting the different value (5/14) that
  today's own remote-VM measurement found for 212 specifically. Left a note
  on both explaining the discovery and fix.
  - **Open question for Gary**: today's independent 212 measurement
    (lmbench reps run at ~47-53s each on the actual remote VM) found
    extended=14 targets 212's own ~12 min duration slightly more precisely
    than the 112/312-matched value of 13. Left at 13 here since matching
    siblings was the deliberate 09-07 call on this template — not
    overridden without confirmation. Flagged in both the override notes
    and the spreadsheet notes; a one-line change to `212`/`412` in
    `config/parameter_overrides.yaml` and the two rows' `extended` cells if
    Gary wants 14 instead.
- **Verification**: full cell-by-cell diff of both `BenchmarkSpecDefinitions.xlsx`
  sheets against the pre-edit workbook confirmed exactly 22 cells changed
  (9 in `Workload_Definitions`, 13 in `Parameters_SmokeBaselineExtend` —
  12 for the 6 value+notes pairs, 1 for 212's notes-only update), nothing
  from the metrics-rewrite work touched. Systematically checked all 41
  pre-existing override entries (not just the 7 in scope) against this
  template's live spreadsheet before touching anything, to catch exactly
  this kind of independent-lineage drift; 212/412 were the only two that
  diverged.

## 2026-09-08 — New #3 metrics for babelstream-hbm-amd / hipmemcpy-bandwidth-amd (114/314, 115/315)

Gary's call: workloads 114/314 (hipMemcpy Bandwidth Test) and 115/315
(BabelStream HBM Bandwidth) had dropped to 2 real metrics each once their old
#3 entries -- 114/314's "Pinned/pageable: sweep flag only" (no key at all) and
115/315's "Kernel time, fixed 1.0 (runtime_ms)" (a hardcoded-1.0 constant,
never a real measurement) -- are removed per the pending 26-tag metric-
deletion review. Both components previously relied entirely on the generic
auto-generated `scripts/parse_results.py` (no component-specific parser
existed for either), which only ever exposes a single blind mean per raw CSV
column. Added a dedicated `scripts/parse_results.py` to each component so a
real, code-grounded #3 could be added instead of leaving both workloads at 2
metrics:

- `babelstream-hbm-amd`: `hip_stream.cpp` genuinely times Copy/Mul/Add/Triad/
  Dot independently (`time_kernel()` per kernel), but the generic parser's
  blind mean across all 5 rows only ever surfaced `bandwidth_gb_s` (#1) and
  `peak_percent` (#2) as one number each, discarding the real per-kernel
  spread. The new parser adds `"kernel"` to `_PIVOT_GROUP_COLUMNS`, giving
  every kernel its own `bandwidth_gb_s_<kernel>` / `peak_percent_<kernel>` /
  `runtime_ms_<kernel>` key; #3 cites `bandwidth_gb_s_triad` specifically,
  since Triad is the workload's namesake combined-bandwidth kernel. Unlike
  the base template's tier/benchmark pivot (which drops the blind mean once
  real per-group keys exist), this component's copy keeps the blind mean in
  place, since #1/#2 already cite it and must keep resolving unchanged.
- `hipmemcpy-bandwidth-amd`: `hip_memcpy_bw.cpp` sweeps min_bytes..max_bytes
  per direction (H2D/D2H/D2D), but the generic parser's blind mean over
  `bandwidth_gbps` blends all three directions and every swept size --
  including small, latency-dominated transfers -- into one number. The new
  parser adds `add_peak_direction_bandwidth()`, which isolates the standard
  sustained-bandwidth figure per direction: the mean `bandwidth_gbps` among
  rows at that direction's own largest swept `transfer_size_bytes`. #3 cites
  `bandwidth_gbps_h2d`; `bandwidth_gbps_d2h`/`bandwidth_gbps_d2d` are computed
  the same way for consistency but not currently cited as metrics.
- Necessary companion fix (not scope creep): 115/315's existing #2 cited the
  bare numeral `(100)` -- not a real column -- and only ever resolved via
  `print_metric_summary.py`'s last-resort position-fallback (exact-count
  match between unresolved metrics and unused numeric keys). Adding ~10 new
  per-kernel keys via the pivot broke that fallback's exact-count condition,
  which would have made #2 unresolvable ("NOT FOUND") the moment #3 was
  added. Fixed by changing #2's parenthetical to cite the real `peak_percent`
  key directly, restoring exact-name resolution. Verified via
  `print_metric_summary.py`'s actual `resolve_metrics()` against real test
  data that all three metrics (#1/#2/#3) now resolve by name for both 115
  and 315.
- Also corrected a stale Parser Notes claim for 115/315 ("hardcoded 53 GB/s
  reference") to the real value used by `collect_workload.py`
  (`peak_percent = min(100, bandwidth_gb_s/5300*100)` -- 5300 GB/s, not 53),
  and corrected 315's "Output Fields / Metrics to Parse" cell, which had
  described an entirely different, non-matching CSV schema (`kernel_name,
  array_size, best_time_ms, ...`) left over from an earlier design; it now
  matches 115's (and the actual collector's) real columns.
- Updated both components' `component.json` to add `scripts/parse_results.py`
  to `overlay` and `provides`, since both previously relied entirely on the
  materializer's generic fallback parser (`_is_empty()` check in
  `materialize_generated_harness.py`) and had no parser of their own.
- No change to either collector's raw CSV output (`hip_stream.cpp`,
  `hip_memcpy_bw.cpp`, and both `collect_workload.py` wrappers are untouched)
  -- only the parsing/summarization step changed, so `Raw Output Example`
  cells were left as-is.
- Scope note: this pass only applied the #3 addition (and its required #2
  fix) for 114/314/115/315, per Gary's explicit "let's go with #3 for both of
  them and not worry about #4 or anything else." The other 22 tags in the
  pending 26-tag metric-deletion review, the 28-row p50/p95/p99 rename batch,
  the AMD vLLM Inference-Throughput (128/328) `METRIC_COLUMNS` rename, and
  the 129-4/329-4 (and parallel 229-4/429-4) ITL/TPOT label fixes remain
  separately pending and were not touched here.

## 2026-09-07 — Metrics column compressed to <=70 chars/metric

Gary's call: the 9/6 audit's per-metric disclosure sentences (often 150-250+
chars, explaining exactly why a percentile wasn't independently measured)
were too long for a metric-and-a-value summary line, and risked repeating the
same rationale in every run's log forever. Rewrote all `Metrics` column
entries across all 128 workload rows so each numbered entry -- "#N: label
(key);" -- is <=70 characters including the leading "#N: " and trailing ";".

- Where a percentile claim was fake (synthesized, duplicated across p50/p95/
  p99, or actually just a mean), the label now states what is really being
  reported (e.g. "IOPS aggregate", "Batch latency, mean step time") instead
  of spelling out the discrepancy -- matching Gary's stated principle: if you
  can't get p50, but you can get the mean, say "mean" and give the value.
  Short fabrication markers are kept where a value is estimated rather than
  measured (e.g. workload 131/231's TTFT: "TTFT, est. 0.4x E2E").
- Multi-key parentheticals (e.g. "(iops_p50, iops_p95, iops_p99)") were
  reduced to the one key `print_metric_summary.py` actually resolves and
  prints -- `resolve_metrics()` only ever uses the first candidate that
  matches a real column, so the other listed keys were never printed under
  the old text either; nothing was lost by dropping them.
- A handful of workloads (201, 227, and their 401/427 siblings) have
  auto-generated collector column names 50+ characters long on their own
  (e.g. `kv_cache_hbm_utilization_gb_and_percentage_of_capacity`), leaving no
  room for any descriptive label under the 70-char cap -- those entries cite
  the bare key with no label. Shortening those column names themselves is a
  collector-code change, out of scope for this spreadsheet-only pass; see
  Gary's review table for the full list.
- The 100-series/300-series (AMD) and 200-series/400-series (NVIDIA) rows
  were confirmed byte-identical before this pass, so only 64 unique blocks
  needed authoring; both siblings in each pair received the same text.
- No code or parser changes were required for the length limit itself --
  `print_metric_summary.py`'s masking/splitting logic is length-agnostic and
  resolves metrics by name, not position, so a short, clean parenthetical is
  if anything easier for it to match than the old prose-heavy asides.
- As with the 9/6 pass and the NUMA-cache fix earlier today, this only
  updates the generator's spreadsheet -- already-generated repos (the
  101-132/201-232 TEMPLATE_00_78 batch currently running) keep their
  baked-in `benchmark_specification.json` Metrics text until regenerated.

## 2026-09-07 — AMD NUMA-cache metrics wiring fix (110/310)

Root-caused why workloads 110/310's `metrics_summary.txt` printed NOT FOUND for
metrics #3-#5 (cross-socket ratio, NUMA bandwidth, cache-miss counters) despite
the 2026-09-06 metrics-accuracy pass: those three values were always correctly
computed by the `numa-cache-collector` overlay (`collect_numa_cache.py`) and
present in `overlay.csv`/`run.log`'s embedded METRICS_CSV block, but the locked
`numa-cache-wrapper-amd` component's `scripts/collect_workload.py` hardcoded a
10-column header when projecting the overlay's output into the harness's
`raw_results.csv` -- silently dropping `cross_socket_numa_penalty_ratio`,
`numa_local_vs_remote_bandwidth_gb_sec`, and `cache_miss_counters_misses_sec`
before `parse_results.py`/`print_metric_summary.py` ever saw them. The NVIDIA
sibling (210/410) never had this bug: its per-repo `collect_workload.py` is a
thin dispatcher that copies the overlay's raw output verbatim, no projection.

- Fixed `implementation_components/numa-cache-wrapper-amd/files/scripts/collect_workload.py`:
  `header` now includes all 5 real metric columns, matching what the overlay
  already produces (no parser change needed -- `parse_results.py` already
  treats any non-parameter, non-skip-listed CSV column as a metric).
- Rewrote the 110/310 `Metrics`, `Output Fields / Metrics to Parse`, `Parser
  and Normalization Notes`, and `Raw Output Example` columns in
  `BenchmarkSpecDefinitions.xlsx` to drop the now-inaccurate "overlay only,
  not in the harness raw file" language and cite the real keys, matching the
  style already used for #1/#2.
- Repos already generated from `numa-cache-wrapper-amd` (e.g. the 101-132
  TEMPLATE_00_78 batch) predate this fix and will keep printing NOT FOUND for
  #3-#5 until regenerated/rematerialized against the patched component.

## 2026-09-07 — TEMPLATE_00_78 NVIDIA 201–232 runtime findings (00_77 H100)

Ported the 00_77 201–232 REPEAT/generation failures so the next NVIDIA batch does not rediscover them.

- **205 tensor correctness**: generated validator no longer requires `run.rc > 0`. Parser/ledger skip process columns (`rc`, `command`, `check`). Ledger metric fill uses `print_metric_summary.resolve_metrics` so `(pass_rate_percent)` is not replaced by positional `rc=0`. Setup installs `numpy`.
- **211 perf PMU**: setup installs `linux-tools-$(uname -r)` when available. Collector prefers the versioned `perf` binary and explains wrapper-miss vs PMU-permission failures. Still refuses to invent IPC.
- **212 lmbench**: per-command timeouts 30/60/120 → 120/180/180; catch `TimeoutExpired`; read last `lat_mem_rd` table line. AMD sibling timeouts raised to match.
- **218 cuDNN**: NVIDIA skeleton apt-installs `libcudnn9-*-cuda-12/13` before `scripts/build.sh` when `src/cudnn_conv.cu` is present.
- **230/231 SGLang**: Ubuntu 24.04 pins `sglang==0.5.19`, `torch==2.13.0+cu130`, `sglang-kernel==0.4.6.post1` (cu130 wheel index). Setup verifies `import sgl_kernel` and `http_server.launch_server`.

## 2026-09-07 — TEMPLATE_00_78 MI300X duration and correctness pass

Ported the 00_77 generation/runtime findings into this template so the next 101–132 batch does not rediscover them.

- **114 hipMemcpy**: overlay now ships `src/hip_memcpy_bw.cpp`. `direction: all` runs H2D+D2H+D2D; `--pinned-memory true` is a boolean; `--help` works. Collector no longer invents 1024-byte stub rows.
- **115 BabelStream**: overlay ships `src/hip_stream.cpp`. Collector keeps printed GB/s (no `/1000`). Extended `num_iterations` 70300 → 60000 so wall clock stays under 15 min.
- **116 RCCL**: overlay ships `src/rccl_perf.cpp`. Iterations 200000/500000 → 660000/1500000 and `max_bytes` 16MiB → 64MiB so baseline/extended are minutes, not 90s/3min local copies.
- **117 rocBLAS GEMM**: `num_iterations` 72000/201000 → 200000/480000 (~4 / ~10 min of the locked torch.matmul loop).
- **124 SDXL**: `num_images` 15/7 → 80/160 so generate time is not buried under model load.
- **128/129 vLLM**: extended `output_len` 37200 → 18600. The locked client still does 16 seqs / conc 8 / two repeats; 37200 ran ~23 min.
- **130/131 SGLang**: setup extras install `jsonschema` (and requests/ipython). Setup and `ensure_setup.sh` require `from sglang.srt.entrypoints.http_server import launch_server`. Prompt-response client keeps CSV in `raw_output.txt`. Compile extras restore ROCm torch after PyPI pulls CUDA wheels.
- **Other**: hyphen-insensitive overlay selectors; `gpu_memory_utilization: 0.9` dumped as a float; generated-repo CRLF scan skips `third_party/`, `results/raw/`, and `.cache/`.

## 2026-09-06 — Metrics accuracy and parser correctness pass

This pass tracked down why several workloads' generated `results/summary.json` didn't
line up with what the spreadsheet's **Metrics** column promised, fixed the root causes
in the shared parsing code, and then used that fix to audit and rewrite the Metrics
column for all 128 workload rows (32 workload slots × AMD/NVIDIA × Ubuntu 24.04/26.04).

### Fixed (shared parser / print-summary code)

- **Paren-unaware text splitting** in `scripts/print_metric_summary.py` was fragmenting
  Metrics spec text on every comma/semicolon, including ones inside parentheses —
  now parenthetical content is masked before splitting and restored after.
- **Silent positional-index fallback** could mislabel a metric with the wrong key
  when counts didn't line up — replaced with unique-prefix matching and an
  unambiguous-count-only positional fallback.
- **Underscore-grouped numeric strings** (e.g. `"0_32768"`) were accepted by a bare
  `float()` call and treated as real numeric metrics — `to_number()` now requires a
  real numeric-literal shape.
- **Case-sensitive column exclusion** let a workload's own uppercase `Parameter_NN`
  name (e.g. GEMM's `"M"`) collide with a same-named lowercase raw CSV column,
  crashing SQLite table creation — comparisons are now case-insensitive.
- **Missing schema-reserved-column exclusions** caused the same class of SQLite
  crash when a collector emitted its own column matching a hardcoded schema name
  (e.g. sdxl-diffusers' own `created_at`).
- **Long-format ("one row per named entity") raw tables** were blended into one
  meaningless mean instead of one value per entity. `build_metrics_summary()` now
  pivots on a `tier` or `benchmark` grouping column into per-entity keys (e.g.
  multichase's `latency_ns_l1/l2/l3/local_dram/remote_dram`, lmbench's
  `lat_ctx`/`bw_mem`/`bw_pipe`/...), and drops the now-superseded blended mean so it
  can't be mistaken for a real aggregate.

### Changed (spreadsheet)

- Rewrote the **Metrics** column (and, where the underlying behavior needed
  explaining, the **Parser and Normalization Notes** column) for all 128 rows in
  `BenchmarkSpecDefinitions.xlsx`, applying one consistent standard: every numbered
  entry cites the literal `summary.json` key it resolves against, including
  placeholder/hardcoded/formula-derived values (with the caveat stated inline);
  bundled p50/p95/p99-style entries are collapsed to one honest entry where the
  collector only ever produces one real aggregate; wording is kept consistent
  between AMD and NVIDIA siblings for conceptually equivalent metrics even where the
  underlying key names differ; and the 300/400 (Ubuntu 26.04) rows — previously
  written in a different, looser convention — now mirror their corrected 100/200
  counterpart, since the underlying collector commands were confirmed identical.
- Result: of the 62 workloads with usable, freshly re-collected real data, all 62
  now resolve every real, measurable metric declared in their Metrics column
  (up from roughly 3 of 64 at the start of this effort). 6 of those 62 additionally
  carry one or more deliberate "this column is not emitted here" disclosure entries,
  which correctly resolve to "not found," since no such key exists.

### Known limitations / recommended follow-ups

- **Fabricated TTFT (workloads 131/231, mirrored at 331/431)**: Time-To-First-Token
  is computed as `0.4 × end-to-end latency`, not independently measured, for both
  the AMD and NVIDIA SGLang serving-latency collectors. This is now honestly
  disclosed in the Metrics/Notes text, but the right long-term fix is a real
  streaming TTFT measurement, mirroring the fix already applied to vLLM.
- **NVIDIA thermal-throttle counter (203/403)**: the substring match for `"Active"`
  also matches the literal text `"Not Active"`, inflating the throttle-event count —
  it is not a reliable throttle indicator today.
- **AMD rocBLAS GEMM micro (117/317)**: the binary is never executed; throughput is
  formula-derived and the CPU-side comparison numbers are hardcoded placeholders,
  unlike the NVIDIA cuBLAS sibling (217/417), which measures real throughput, memory
  bandwidth, and L2 error.
- **AMD hipMemcpy (114/314)**: H2D and D2H bandwidth are not measured independently —
  one shared value stands in for both directions, unlike the NVIDIA sibling
  (214/414), which measures H2D/D2H/D2D independently.
- **Workload 132/332 (RAG+FAISS, AMD)**: the currently retained sample run's
  `raw_results.csv` holds only a bare summary line with no data rows — a
  pre-existing environment/run defect unrelated to this pass. Its NVIDIA sibling
  (232/432) already has clean data and confirmed-matching key names; a clean AMD
  re-run should verify against those directly.
- **Workload 211/411 (linux-perf-pmu, NVIDIA)**: every captured run on this host
  failed with `perf_event_open` permission denied ("No permission to enable cycles
  event") — a host/environment permissions gap, not a spec or parser defect.
- A few constant, per-run configuration values (e.g. multichase's `thread_count`,
  GUPS' `num_iterations_ran`) still leak into the metrics dict rather than being
  excluded as parameters. Harmless today — they're never cited in the Metrics
  column — but worth a follow-up code fix for full hygiene.

## 2026-09-06 — GUPS cross-vendor standardization and parameter_overrides.yaml reconciliation

This pass closed out the remaining gaps between `config/parameter_overrides.yaml` and
`BenchmarkSpecDefinitions.xlsx`, so the spreadsheet alone is now authoritative for every
workload's smoke/baseline/extended parameter values -- no override-file lookup required
to get the currently-intended numbers.

### Changed (spreadsheet)

- **GUPS Random Memory (113/213/313/413)**: `num_iterations` standardized to
  baseline=200/extended=125 across both AMD (MI300X) and NVIDIA (H100) so `num_updates`,
  `table_size`, `num_threads`, and `num_iterations` are now identical cross-vendor for
  this workload. Previously AMD and NVIDIA disagreed on scaling direction (AMD's
  baseline exceeded extended; NVIDIA's did not) purely because each was independently
  tuned to hit a wall-clock duration target on hardware that runs the same total work
  at very different speeds (AMD's collector is single-threaded Python/numpy; NVIDIA's
  is a compiled multi-threaded OpenMP C binary). Both baseline and extended values are
  now empirically confirmed on real hardware (AMD: 4:35 baseline, ~15 min extended
  target calibrated from a real 20-iteration sample; NVIDIA: 0:50 baseline, ~1:12
  extended at the shared iteration count).
- **132/332 RAG Pipeline `query_count`**: raised from a stale 100/250 hang-risk cap to
  200/500. Traced the actual mechanism in the AMD/NVIDIA RAG-FAISS collector: per-query
  cost is linear (~1.18s/query, one embed+retrieve+rerank+generate pass, no retry/repeat
  construct), so the documented hang risk was from an earlier, unrelated bug (a
  duration-target formula that produced query counts in the tens of millions) and does
  not apply to this 2-5x increase.
- **124/324 Stable Diffusion XL `num_images`**: baseline raised from 7 to 15
  (extended unchanged at 7), per the MI300X VF timing note (7 images was 1:54; 15 images
  targets 3-5 min).
- **Ten remaining AMD-side override rows folded into the spreadsheet directly**: 110
  (NUMA cache `num_iterations`), 116/316 (RCCL bandwidth), 119/319 (PyTorch microkernel),
  120/320 (rocHPL `problem_size_N` and `num_iterations` -- clamps N to 32768 after a
  documented 228-minute hang at 65536), 123/323 (BERT inference), 126/326 (JAX XLA
  transformer). All were previously only correct if `config/parameter_overrides.yaml`
  was actually consulted at generation time; they are now correct directly in the
  spreadsheet regardless.
- **Six twin-gap workloads resolved** (313, 319, 323, 324, 326, 332): these AMD Ubuntu
  26.04 siblings previously carried byte-identical stale pre-retune values (and notes)
  copied from their 1xx AMD siblings' old state, with no override entry to correct them.
  All six now mirror their sibling's current, retuned value.
- All 28 entries in `config/parameter_overrides.yaml` now match `BenchmarkSpecDefinitions.xlsx`
  exactly (verified programmatically).

### Fixed (docs)

- `docs/AI_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` had a stale instruction limiting automatic
  `config/parameter_overrides.yaml` application to "116/316 and 120/320 only" -- a
  leftover from when the override file had two entries; it now has 28. Corrected to
  state the override applies to every workload it names, matching what
  `scripts/generate_benchmark_config.py` actually does in code.

### Known follow-ups

- `config/parameter_overrides.yaml` itself has not been deleted. It is now fully
  redundant with the spreadsheet (every entry matches), but removing it, along with the
  override-loading code in `matrix_profile_values.py` / `generate_benchmark_config.py` /
  `extract_benchmark_definition.py`, is a separate, not-yet-started cleanup step.
